Great article.. 

We all know that this is to push an agenda. It has always been about that. The government wants more control over the energy sector and they are certainly making progress down that path.

But what about those that work 9-5, work overtime, work weekends, and then have to come home to take care of their kids. What about those who have had life literally kick the shit out of them. There are some people, some Americans, that work their asses off and still cannot afford healthcare. What about all of these people? What do you think of them?

We have a special rule in this country where a Kennedy has to kill a person and then be found with the body before there can be any legal consequences.  Merely driving under the influence is like a Tuesday night to the Kennedys.

Isn't it ironic that teacher tenure, the war on drugs, urban renewal, minimum wage laws, zoning laws, occupational licensing laws, and other examples of institutional racism, government legislation that engenders black poverty, were created by progressives who proclaim themselves to be the loudest champions of the poor and minorities?

Only in today's America, where things continue to go down the drain, does a group like this get tax payer dollars. They are political group, make no doubts about it.  

And what exactly do they even have to do with Parenthood? Nothing. They do more to promote sex and preventing parenthood than anything. 

Simply astonishing that a dime of tax payer money goes to this group. Let them survive on their own through donations. Let liberal hollywood fund them. Let liberals put their money where their mouth is.
-----==----==---==-----

This is the sort of thing that burns me up. People like Reid get away with this sort of talk and outright lies all the damn time. The media just shrugs it off and gives it no attention. 
There is no doubt in my mind, this country would be so much better off if we didnt have a bias media that blatantly covers for and pushes liberal agenda. As long as we have a corrupt media in the tank, this country will continue to go down the drain.

The Cold War happened because Russia's hegemony consisted of half of Europe and was exerted by force.

I like the implication that "right-wingers" aren't educated professionals.

Apparently 4chan is made up of doctors, lawyers, clergy and college professors.
-----==----==---==-----
Being an Israeli I've never had any problems in the US but many in Europe. And none of the instances in Europe were from the "right wing". Outside of Eastern Europe, anti-semitism is a very left wing thing these days as far-right anti-semitic groups are so small and isolated
-----==----==---==-----
Right off the bat you can see this study has no ability to be generalized, and on top of that there is a reasonable explanation for those in the group whom the study deemed to be "anti-Semitic". First off, the study is in Germany, an place as we all know has a history of anti-semitism. Now this is not to say that if you are German you are more likely to be anti -semetic, but if we look at those whom the study found to be more likely to be anti-semetic it says that doctors, lawyers, clergy, and college professors; and that group in itself lends its makeup to a particular set of individuals. More so than not, that group is made up of individuals whom tend to be older, therefore they share a connection with the past in Germany; it is likely that their parents or themselves were raised to be anti-semetic and those traits are hard not to be passed down. The difference with this group and a younger group is that the younger group would have been exposed to being raised in a world which frowned upon anti-semitism. For me to believe that this study was valid I would like to see it be conducted in other regions, as well as with people in various age groups. 
-----==----==---==-----
Colleges have always been bastions of anti-Semitism, just look at the ASA boycott of Israel.
-----==----==---==-----
Doesn't surprise me.
-----==----==---==-----
It's easy to catch whomever you want in that dragnet as the definition seems pretty fluid.
-----==----==---==-----
As a Republican and an Orthodox Jew, it's always been clear to me that the Antisemitism comes mostly from the left. 
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;The study reported that 80 percent of the letters were anti-Israel, often masking anti-Semitic feelings.

Haha what is this study?
-----==----==---==-----
[National Brotherhood Week](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIlJ8ZCs4jY) is early this year.
-----==----==---==-----
It's hard to know how seriously to take this. I suspect their definition of anti-semitism may have conflated anti-semitism with opposition to Israel and/or Israeli policy.

Take this statement:

&gt; The researchers found that many of the letters equated the actions of the Israel Defense Forces to the Nazi genocide of the Jews.

While it may be hyperbole and particularly offensive to those being criticized it is not on it's face anti-semetic. Criticism of particular acts by a particular government, is not a statement about a race/religion. Israel and the IDF are engaged in a perpetual war of ethnic and religious resentments and hatreds, given human nature it'd be nearly impossible that those resentments haven't boiled over into atrocities and injustice. When those arise the ethnic nature of the conflict and the identity of one of the participants invites the comparison.

I really think that saying this bill had nothing to do with gays is the same as saying literacy test laws from the post Civil War era had nothing to do with blacks. Neither specifically stated their target, but it can't be denied that they both impact those respective groups.
-----==----==---==-----
Very well said. Israel is shamed when they are the only people who hold our western values in that region. They fall and there will simply be another tyrannical enemy in their place. If they thrive we share in the bounty.

At best she admits it was all her fault and had nothing to do with Obama and goes to jail. At worst she will lie and get away with it like every other politician. History tells us the latter is most likely.

More likely? She will continue to lie and protect Obozo.

I feel like there has to be a better quote out there than this one.

I still like the argument that it doesn't just apply to gays. If a Jew doesn't want to cater to a Nazi rally, they don't have to.

No matter how you look at it someone is going to feel discriminated, you need to look at the lesser of the two and figure out which is getting the raw end. Is it the christian who is losing money by saying no, or the LGBTQ patron who is being made to feel second class because of refusal of service.

-----==----==---==-----
Welcome to /r/conservative Senator.  Glad you took the time to drop by.  Sorry some of your colleagues say dumb things.  
-----==----==---==-----
I like the part where you pointed out the source of the majority leaders "study"

paraphrased "here is some proof I will read written by a guy I pay to write things I want to hear"
-----==----==---==-----
Yes.
-----==----==---==-----
Yes.  It's a damn waste of resources, if nothing else.
-----==----==---==-----
Unless you can argue that marijuana is more dangerous than alcohol it seems to be a double standard to me, and an invasive government practice.
-----==----==---==-----
I sure as hell do.  I don't believe the interstate commerce clause should cover agricultural crops or any other products that never cross state lines.  Federal regulation is therefore unconstitutional, in my opinion, unless they wanted to ban transporting it across state lines only.

Of course, my opinion on the out-of-control federal power grab via the commerce clause is not how the majority sees it, which is depressing.  Some people have no problem with an authoritarian federal government as long as *their guy* is in charge.
-----==----==---==-----
Of course.  A lifetime of smoking pot may have measurable effects on one's cognition, but they pale in comparison to the effects of a single pot possession conviction.  

In addition to legal fees, marks on your permanent record, and possible jail time, a single pot conviction makes you ineligible to receive federal student aid, including grants, loans, and even work study.

It's also a good idea to Legalize It if you are worried by the militarization of our police.  Also, since there is no reason pot can't be grown in the states, we can stop sending billions to foreign cartels and instead keep those dollars within our borders and increase tax revenues with minimal harm to the economy.
-----==----==---==-----
I personally don't believe marijuana laws should be relaxed 
-----==----==---==-----
Well, this one does.

Here is ballot from last years vote in Colorado.

-----==----==---==-----
I do. Drug war was stupid and still is stupid :-) 
-----==----==---==-----
In general, I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want to themselves (harmful or not), but the corollary to that is that they must be held personally accountable for their actions.

For example, someone that contracts hepatitis C from intravenous drug use (and is not covered by their own insurance) would need to personally cover their own medial expenses and not receive aid derived from society (ie. our taxes).

I suppose marijuana would be treated somewhat like alcohol -- I  expect if someone decides to go out driving with impaired reflexes (after smoking a few joints) then injures or kills someone, they would suffer similar penalties akin to a drunk driver.

I would not support relaxing restrictions on more potent drugs of abuse.  Significant alteration of a person's mental status could cause harm to the rest of society and not just to the abusing individual.
-----==----==---==-----
The National Review, the most prestigious conservative journal, has been advocating for relaxing marijuana laws for decades.  This is old news for conservatives.

We should keep in mind that marijuana legalization will not be without its pitfalls.  Casual use will probably go up, especially among teenagers.  Excessive marijuana use is damaging to the developing brain.
-----==----==---==-----
yes. I believe that it should be regulated, not a free for all. I very strongly support Marijuana being 21 or older, including for medical reasons. 

I would go so far as to suggest that we invest more in rehab facilities rather that DEA agents. At the local level judges should be given more freedom to decide how a person should be treated. Addiction is a mental health issue, not a criminal. 

On a side note what is going on in Colorado, Washington with Eric holder simply ignoring the law is wrong. Congress should act. He is picking and choosing what laws to follow.......
-----==----==---==-----
Will I ever do it? No. Do I want my kids or their friends doing it? No. Are people going to do it anyway? Of course. I don't like it, but I like drug cartels even less. Keep US money in the US.
-----==----==---==-----
Yes they should be relaxed but IMO there are certain fields where people shouldn’t be smoking pot and businesses should be allowed to drug test individuals and say 'No seek employment elsewhere' without being chastised for it.
-----==----==---==-----
No. 

Not if it means additional taxation, government bureaucracy to control it, crony capitalism to export profits from it, and more state dependents to suckle at the breast of liberal social policies.

From what I can observe, these have been true in every state where pot had been legalized. 

So hell no.
-----==----==---==-----
No.

Two wrongs don't make a right.  Alcohol is bad but it's an ancient part of our culture and you're not going to get the genie back in the bottle.  

We don't need to legally or culturally sanction another evil genie to make people lazy, content, dumb, and dependent.  It's just "Soma" from "Brave New World".

If we're going to survive as a nation, we need more serious sober people, not more escapists.
-----==----==---==-----
Danger zone:  No.

I think alcohol is an extremely dangerous drug, just like alcohol and tobacco.  Just like alcohol and tobacco I think use is rampant and out of control.  

In regard to legalization, once it's legal it becomes very difficult to make illegal again.  Prohibition failed horrifically and I fear weed would do the same thing.

Quote high times all you like, marijuana is a harmful drug, not unlike alcohol or tobacco, and since the left seems so adept at getting me to pay for the healthcare of others, it is in my best interest that others live a healthy lifestyle.

Since weed is does not cause a chemical dependency, like alcohol or tobacco, pro-legalization people seem to think this means that it isn't addictive at all.  First off, I don't understand why people think that means weed isn't addictive at all.  Weed can cause serious psychosocial dependency.  Second, I don't understand why people are so willing to pollute themselves with a substance so disgusting there is never a time that someone's body actually wants it.

Furthermore, weed has been a great gateway drug to meth and other uppers.  This comes from friends in law enforcement, personal experience, and Drew Penske of all people.  

Finally, the libertarian approach to politics seems to have far more faith in mankind than I do.  If I thought for an instant that people could use weed safely and without affecting me or endangering my loved ones I would change my views.  If libertarians were actually running the show, and I could believe the underlying reasons behind legalizations were personal freedom rather than just wanting to be able to toke up without feet of legal problems I would be all for it.  I have yet to find anyone who has never smoked nor intends to that is pro-legalization.  If I do, I will listen to their arguments.

TL:DR; weed is just as bad as alcohol and tobacco.  Since I am being expected to pay for the health of others I do not want to see it legalized.  The reason I don't support making alcohol or tobacco illegal is because I don't think it would work.
-----==----==---==-----

That's really sad about being newlyweds, as a newlywed myself it's nerve racking. Of course, this guy seems to have been an angry intoxicant considering he assaulted the taxicab driver and then when the police officer, off-duty, shows up to arrest the guy he resists and then gets on top of the officer and starts pounding his face, with video that's an open and close case to me. 
-----==----==---==-----
seams to me that beating a cop is going to end up in you getting shot. Also I love how the 2 people  behind the camera are automatically against the cop up until he's getting his face smashed. They could have intervened at any time, but instead they stood there and made commentary.

Another way of reading that would be that Dinesh paid him in exchange for what he said in his movie.

It sounds to me like the kids wearing the American flag t-shirts were doing it specifically to piss off the kids from Mexico. The opinion even mentions that there had been a race-related altercation on campus earlier that school year, and that the school had a history of gang-related and race-related violence. I mean, come on, a "group of students" all wore American flag t-shirts on the same day? They did it for a reason. It was coordinated, and intended to make the Mexican kids feel like outsiders for wanting to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. This isn't a case of some kid innocently wearing an American flag t-shirt to school on Cinco de Mayo and being called out by classmates. I think that would yield a different result.

Brewer was in a tough spot here.  While signing the bill was the right thing to do in terms of law, the gay opposition to it was well-organized, relentless and perfectly willing to distort the truth to get attention.

The bill's supporters did not organize the same sort of public relations campaign, and so the public perception of the bill was very bad.

The lesson learned from this is that it is not just sufficient to get the law passed, but you need to mobilize to counter the gay propaganda machine.

I'm giving Brewer a pass on this one -- she was left in the lurch.  She needed more support from us conservatives, and we came up a day late and a dollar short.
-----==----==---==-----
I really think that saying this bill had nothing to do with gays is the same as saying literacy test laws from the post Civil War era had nothing to do with blacks. Neither specifically stated their target, but it can't be denied that they both impact those respective groups.

And the West continues to support the uprising.

Appeasement.  I wonder if they have to pay the non-Muslim tax too

By: Charles Benninghoff, Founder

The names of the 22 RINOs (Republicans In Name Only) in House Speaker John Boehner’s inner circle of amnesty supporters have finally come to light.

These 22 men are fighting hard to give your job away to the first available illegal alien.

This push to give American jobs away to illegal aliens is being fueled by internationalists like the US Chamber of Commerce and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

Zuckerberg has been using his fortune to lobby Congress in favor of amnesty for illegal aliens for the past year. He claims that Americans do not want to work. You may ask yourself, is this true? Judging by Zuckerberg’s own track record, we have to say, “It is absolutely not true!”

Facebook recently acquired a company called WhatsApp for $19 billion. What the news presstitutes didn’t tell you was that a few years ago, the two software engineers who founded WhatsApp applied for jobs at Facebook and Zuckerberg turned them both down.

These two American software engineers, who very much wanted to work, then sat down around their kitchen table and designed the popular mobile phone app known as WhatsApp. Zuckerberg could have hired both of them and paid them outrageous salaries and benefits for the rest of their lives and still made great profits.

Instead, he chose not to hire American workers, and it ended up costing him $19 billion for that decision.

Zuckerberg would much rather have Congress pass amnesty so he can hire foreign software engineers for much lower salaries than Americans will accept.

Zuckerberg and his hypocritical ilk, who are not Americans in their political ideologies, are the ones pushing to give your job or your loved one’s job away to an illegal alien. This Zuckerberg story highlights the fact that American workers are not only talented, but they want to work.

In my internet experience, American workers are far smarter and much more resourceful than virtually all foreigners. We do not want to see our jobs or the jobs of our neighbors given away to incompetent illegal aliens who will work for lower wages.

John Boehner just sat down for another meeting with Obama to discuss amnesty “strategy” again. Boehner and his inner circle are still fighting to ram amnesty through the House this year.

There is a reason why Boehner and his inner circle have abandoned their conservative principles (and the Republican Party Platform, which explicitly opposes amnesty) in favor of the illegal alien lobby.

Mark Zuckerberg, the US Chamber of Commerce and other pro-amnesty, anti-American-worker Big Business interests are handing out big sacks of cash to any Republican who will vote for amnesty. Some call these campaign contributions, but we call them what they are:  Bribes!

Boehner’s inner circle of RINOs needs to feel the heat from you on this. They need to know that we support American jobs for American workers and that we won’t allow them to give our jobs away to foreign invaders.

Supporting amnesty is an act of contempt toward American workers. These Big Business interests are wrecking the American economy and giving our jobs away to illegal aliens so we can all live in mud huts, just so Mark Zuckerberg and his friends can hire cheap foreign software engineers.

Amnesty is the opposite of compassion and love for our neighbors. I believe we can defeat this amnesty scam. Our opposition to amnesty just needs to outweigh any perceived benefit that Boehner and his allies think they are getting.

We are the ones who will be impoverished by amnesty, so we must be the ones to speak up now!

We may not have Mark Zuckerberg’s cash, but we have our votes and our voices. If enough of us speak up right now, we can still make the Boehner gang back down.

Find out exactly who is in Boehner’s pro-amnesty, anti-American inner circle by visiting the link below. Please also share the link with everyone you know so they can see the list of RINOs names and demand these "RINOs" support American Jobs for American Workers!

It's Zuckerberg's business. Let him do as he pleases.
-----==----==---==-----
These people have a fucked up agenda that involves fundamentally altering America's cultural heritage. 
-----==----==---==-----
Definitely some misconceptions on Facebook here. First of all, anyone the works at Facebook is more or less given a blank check as far as resources go to do whatever they need to in order to complete tasks. So there's absolutely no way he is complaining about having to pay american workers.

No, I think this is some personal political mission about breaking down the class system and turning America into a meritocracy. Where there's so much competition for work that it (supposedly) drives up the quality of american workers. It's a very "Harvard" worldview.

Pretty sure most consumers will see this as simply a political stunt.  This company is taking a political stance.  The mandate hasn't taken effect and when it does the very small % of restaurants that experience increased costs will probably elect to either raise prices across the board or cut costs somewhere else.  In order to have increased costs because of the employer mandate restaurants would need more than 50 employees (usually only restaurants with multiple locations have more than 50 employees), they would also need a significant employee population that work more than 30 hours but don't currently have insurance ( managers usually already have insurance and a significant % of servers are part time), then on top of this those employees would need to elect to take employer provided insurance (as opposed to any government benefit or spousal or parent insurance).  This restaurant might have significant cost increases but as with any capitalist system they better learn to deal with those costs better than their competitors or they will not survive.

&gt;It was only five years ago in December that Al Gore claimed that the polar ice caps would be completely melted by now. But he might be surprised to find out that Arctic ice coverage is up 50 percent this year from 2012 levels.

&gt;“Some of the models suggest that there is a 75 percent chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during some of the summer months, could be completely ice-free within the next five to seven years,” Gore said in 2008.

Based on  research by professor Wieslaw Masluwski which gave the date of  the  first ice free Arctic summer as 2016,+-3 years.   Notice that this says ice free summer,  not that it would be ice free all of the time. 
-----==----==---==-----
“It’s estimated that there were around 20,000 cu km of Arctic sea ice each October in the early 1980s, and so today’s minimum still ranks among the lowest of the past 30 years,” Shepard added.

Arctic sea ice was at its lowest point in 2012.  So low that roughly 80% of scientists predicted that its levels would rise in 2013 as numbers regressed towards the mean.   In the  past 3 decades,  the Arctic has lost 75% of its summer ice cover.

At one point they cut broadcasting to show the vetoing of the bill. It had nothing to do with sports at all.

I'm generally surprised to see the limited interest in NSA revalations among conservative groups. It seems to me that this is the biggest departure from the normative behavior of our government towards its citizens in our nation's history, the current nature of the relationship between us and the government was established in secret with no consent from the general public and essentially no adversarial oversight.

To accept the current nature of America's intelligence apparatus is to be willing to accept absolutely any change, no matter how radical, from established norms of behavior. Or at least to admit that as long as these changes occurred in a way that was sufficiently obfuscated that this is just the way that it has always been...

One quote comes to mind: 

“Could this be the country I had loved, honored, worked for, believed in? The general welfare was forgotten. The land had become a happy hunting ground for adventurers, profiteers, and pirates who called history bunk and used their privileged positions to promote their careers and fill their pockets at the public expense. Peace, progress, and prosperity had become scraps of raw meat, thrown to a pack of venal, military minded ravenous wolves.” -Scott Nearing

Politically for the Republican Party, when the issue is inevitably decided at SCOTUS that gay marriage will be legal in all states, should not the party begin to focus on making sure christians and the religious are not coerced by the state to participate in something they disagree with? For example when polled on the issue most americans thought the baker in the wedding cake controversy should be allowed not to participate in a wedding against her beliefs. 
-----==----==---==-----
Get the government out of the marriage business in the first place.  It isn't the government's place to say who you can and can't commit your life to.  

If you're for smaller government, you can't possibly be for the government controlling marriage.  A free people don't ask for permission.
-----==----==---==-----
Can anybody explain for me why extension of marriage privileges has become a major political issue in our country?
-----==----==---==-----
I really with the US would just get out of the marriage game. Just handle the contractual legislation and let different groups have different celebrations so we're not all purposely stomping on each others' toes for the sake of either being PC or trying to defend our beliefs.
-----==----==---==-----
Marriage given by a government should be unconstitutional either heterosexual or homosexual. Marriage is given from a church, not the government unless the government is linked directly to a specific religion. The US's government is not.

If you want rights, then a civil union can be given out. They would get all the rights that come from it. Then, if you want a marriage, go to a church.

And I'm sure there are churches that marry gay couples.

What pisses me off is that hardly anyone complains about the raising of minimum wage shrinking the middle class.  Say I make $18/hr.  I don't get the raise that minimum wage earners get, but I still have to obtain my commodities from employees making minimum wage, thus my costs go up.  The buying power I had before the raise in minimum wage is shrunk every time minimum wage goes up, bringing me closer to poverty.  Inflation kicks in which removes any benefits of the increase in minimum wage for the impoverished.  So how does this actually have any long term effects?  It doesn't, it keeps the sheep following the carrot on the stick.
-----==----==---==-----
I have a feeling it's going to happen anyways because Hillary wants to win in 2016.

Can't expect someone who thinks the rich need to pay their fair share to actually understand economics. 

Isn't it ironic how people who have at least a better grasp on economics than the dems do, never get a chance to demonstrate it? We've seen what happens when a liberal attempts to stimulate an economy for 6 years, do we really want another 4 years of that? 

When do we call a failed experiment, a failed experiment?

John Adams wrote, "...a government of laws and not of men." Was a basic concept behind the constitution. However it does not apply to the Obama administration.

Bradley A. Smith: Connecting the Dots in the IRS Scandal
The 'smoking gun' in the targeting of conservative groups has been hiding in plain sight.

The mainstream press has justified its lack of coverage over the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups because there's been no "smoking gun" tying President Obama to the scandal. This betrays a remarkable, if not willful, failure to understand abuse of power. The political pressure on the IRS to delay or deny tax-exempt status for conservative groups has been obvious to anyone who cares to open his eyes. It did not come from a direct order from the White House, but it didn't have to.

First, some background: On Jan. 21, 2010, the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Citizens United v. FEC upholding the right of corporations and unions to make independent expenditures in political races. Then, on March 26, relying on Citizens United, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rights of persons (including corporations) to pool resources for political purposes. This allowed the creation of "super PACs" as well as corporate contributions to groups organized under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code that spend in political races.

The reaction to Citizens United was no secret. Various news outlets such as CNN noted that "Democrats fear the decision has given the traditionally pro-business GOP a powerful new advantage."

The 501(c)(4) groups in question are officially known as "social-welfare organizations." They have for decades been permitted to engage in political activity under IRS rules, so long as their primary purpose (generally understood to be less than 50% of their activity) wasn't political. They are permitted to lobby without limitation and are not required to disclose their donors. The groups span the political spectrum, from the National Rifle Association to Common Cause to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. If forced out of 501(c)(4) status, these nonprofit advocacy groups would have to reorganize as for-profit corporations and pay taxes on donations received, or reorganize as "political committees" under Section 527 of the IRS Code and be forced to disclose their donors.

Now consider the following events, all of which were either widely reported, publicly released by officeholders or revealed later in testimony to Congress. These are the dots the media refuse to connect:

• Jan. 27, 2010: President Obama criticizes Citizens United in his State of the Union address and asks Congress to "correct" the decision.

• Feb. 11, 2010: Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) says he will introduce legislation known as the Disclose Act to place new restrictions on some political activity by corporations and force more public disclosure of contributions to 501(c)(4) organizations. Mr. Schumer says the bill is intended to "embarrass companies" out of exercising the rights recognized in Citizens United. "The deterrent effect should not be underestimated," he said.

• Soon after, in March 2010, Mr. Obama publicly criticizes conservative 501(c)(4) organizations engaging in politics. In his Aug. 21 radio address, he warns Americans about "shadowy groups with harmless sounding names" and a "corporate takeover of our democracy."

• Sept. 28, 2010: Mr. Obama publicly accuses conservative 501(c)(4) organizations of "posing as not-for-profit, social welfare and trade groups." Max Baucus, then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, asks the IRS to investigate 501(c)(4)s, specifically citing Americans for Job Security, an advocacy group that says its role is to "put forth a pro-growth, pro-jobs message to the American people."

• Oct. 11, 2010: Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) asks the IRS to investigate the conservative 501(c)(4) Crossroads GPS and "other organizations."

• April 2011: White House officials confirm that Mr. Obama is considering an executive order that would require all government contractors to disclose their donations to politically active organizations as part of their bids for government work. The proposal is later dropped amid opposition across the political spectrum.

• Feb. 16, 2012: Seven Democratic senators— Michael Bennet (Colo.), Al Franken (Minn.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Mr. Schumer, Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Tom Udall (N.M.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.)—write to the IRS asking for an investigation of conservative 501(c)(4) organizations.

• March 12, 2012: The same seven Democrats write another letter asking for further investigation of conservative 501(c)(4)s, claiming abuse of their tax status.

• July 27, 2012: Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) writes one of several letters to then-IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman seeking a probe of nine conservative groups, plus two liberal and one centrist organization. In 2013 testimony to the HouseOversight and Government Reform Committee, former IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller describes Sen. Levin as complaining "bitterly" to the IRS and demanding investigations.

• Aug. 31, 2012: In another letter to the IRS, Sen. Levin calls its failure to investigate and prosecute targeted organizations "unacceptable."

• Dec. 14, 2012: The liberal media outlet ProPublica receives Crossroads GPS's 2010 application for tax-exempt status from the IRS. Because the group's tax-exempt status had not been recognized, the application was confidential. ProPublica publishes the full application. It later reports that it received nine confidential pending applications from IRS agents, six of which it published. None of the applications was from a left-leaning organization.

• April 9, 2013: Sen. Whitehouse convenes the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism to examine nonprofits. He alleges that nonprofits are violating federal law by making false statements about their political activities and donors and using shell companies to donate to super PACs to hide donors' identities. He berates Patricia Haynes, then-deputy chief of Criminal Investigation at the IRS, for not prosecuting conservative nonprofits.

• May 10, 2013: Sen. Levin announces that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will hold hearings on "the IRS's failure to enforce the law requiring that tax-exempt 501(c)(4)s be engaged exclusively in social welfare activities, not partisan politics." Three days later he postpones the hearings when Lois Lerner (then-director of the IRS Exempt Organizations Division) reveals that the IRS had been targeting and delaying the applications of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status.

• Nov. 29, 2013: The IRS proposes new rules redefining "political activity" to include activities such as voter-registration drives and the production of nonpartisan legislative scorecards to restrict what the agency deems as excessive spending on campaigns by tax-exempt 501(c)(4) groups. Even many liberal nonprofits argue that the rule goes too far in limiting their political activity—but the main target appears to be the conservative 501(c)(4)s that have so irritated Democrats.

• Feb. 13, 2014: The Hill newspaper reports that "Senate Democrats facing tough elections this year want the Internal Revenue Service to play a more aggressive role in regulating outside groups expected to spend millions of dollars on their races."

In 1170, King Henry II is said to have cried out, on hearing of the latest actions of the Archbishop of Canterbury, "Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?" Four knights then murdered the archbishop. Many in the U.S. media still willfully refuse to see anything connecting the murder of the archbishop to any actions or abuse of power by the king.

Mr. Smith, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, is chairman of the Center for Competitive Politics.

This doesn't work out for colleges and universities, who need to charge tuition to students (and in the case of more prestigious schools, want students from wealthy families who will donate more money as alums).

liberals are great at creating issues then goading conservatives into permanent debate.  the liberal proposition then takes on a life of its own as it is granted status by the opposition.  the conservative answer is **repeal**
-----==----==---==-----
A Constitutional amendment passing is unlikely, and the GOP would rather focus on smaller topics they can ~~win on~~ generate votes and donations on.  That being said, lots of conservative policy goals require a Supreme Court case overturning a precedent case or a Constitutional amendment.  Off the top of my head, overturning Roe v. Wade and Wickard v. Filburn, and passing a balanced budget amendment.

Obama and the Democrats’ latest attack on our military is absolutely sickening. Obama is proposing a 1-percent across-the-board cut for all US military pay. He also wants to slash military benefits for medical care and to increase costs for families through a proposal to raise prices at military commissaries.  At the same time he is increasing by 1.4% welfare payments to illegal aliens.

I was really impressed with Jon Huntsman last election and would love to see him have another shot in 2016.

Paul or Cruz, else a vote of no confidence. 

Christie is a liberal media fabrication,

Jeb Bush: If anyone votes for another Bush I'm joining the communist party. 
-----==----==---==-----
Huckabee is debating a run too I believe, personally I think a straight up social conservative is a tough sell though.
-----==----==---==-----
Here's how I would break down the field. I consider myself to be pretty fiscally conservative and a moderate social conservative (pro-life, don't care about gay marriage). I also favor pragmatism over ideologues/demagogues as well as electability in the general.

Rand Paul/Scott Walker: I've been pretty impressed with hearing both of these guys speak out in recent months. I think they're both very well-spoken solid-conservatives that have sufficient positive name recognition and could be appealing in a general election. In particular, I think Rand Paul has done a fantastic job managing his image and could be charismatic enough to appeal to independents and moderates while running on a fairly conservative platform.


Rick Snyder/Paul Ryan/Rob Portman//Mitch Daniels: I don't have a problem with any of these guys but I'm not sure if they would be charismatic enough to win. I think they're all pretty competent but may not be exciting enough in a general election. Also, I believe Daniels effectively decided to leave politics since taking the Purdue presidency job as he almost ran last time if not for his family's vehement opposition which seems unlikely to change.

I'd throw Jindal in with the above group of guys except I think he's even worse at building/maintaining an appealing public image. 


Jeb Bush:Not sure about this guy. Seems to generate a lot of hype but I'm not exactly sure why. Reminds me in some ways of Jon Huntsman. I'm sure Jeb Bush is a better politician and more likable than Huntsman but I think he would face the same difficulties that Huntsman did in the last primary. 


Marco Rubio: I don't know what happened to this guy. In the 2012 election, I thought he was one of Romney's best surrogates but he seems to be have pretty much disappeared from the national stage since then. The immigration thing hurt him in my eyes because I think he showed a lot of weakness in publicly advocating one position and then failing to follow through with support for his position. 


Chris Christie: I considered him to be the front-runner before he imploded but I think there's way too much baggage there now. The most disqualifying factor for me is the amateurish way that his staff handled everything. This is a huge red flag for me that indicates he and his staff are not ready for prime time. 

I've been pretty disappointed with Ted Cruz and don't consider him electable in a general election. I think his conduct and general approach has been detrimental to the GOP nationally. I like his principles but I'm not in favor of the way he conducts politics. The fact that I find him so off-putting makes it difficult for me to believe that he would appeal to independent voters. 

-----==----==---==-----
What you have to remember is, the GOP primary usually functions as an inauguration, or demolition derby where the last one standing is the establishment favorite.  Only real exception to this was 2000, but '76, '80, '88, '96, '08, '12 were all headlined by the "second-best" guy from 4 (or 8) years ago.  I'm from Texas, so here's some specific insights about the Texas candidates:

Ted Cruz- don't like this guy personally, love how much he pisses liberals off.  Him and Cornyn have a great good-cop bad-cop thing going right now with the Senate Republican's (same as Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, younger guy pulls the party right, older guy in power "herds cats" and gets Senate R's to unify).  I think Cruz says the right stuff, but his response to Syria ("not our problem") showed a lack of compassion, even if not getting involved was the right call.  He seems like a douche, and I wouldn't want to deal with him as party standard-bearer.  Better he stays in the Senate pissing off liberals.

Rick Perry- this guy looks incredible on paper (14 years as Governor, Texas economy, etc.) but doesn't deliver.  He's all sizzle, no steak.  14 years with no major accomplishments, besides staying out of the way of Texans being awesome, which is good, but we could do better.  Texas has been bright red under his tenure, but instead of pursuing conservative dreams (school choice, open carry, smaller &amp; smarter government), he just hangs out.  He's got the hair and attitude, but it's all fluff.  He never solved school funding (his plan got 0 legislative support, literally 0 votes), his Trans-Texas Corridor flopped, he tried to mandate giving the HPV vaccine to 12-year-old girls without even passing it through the legislature, etc.  Not a real conservative by my standard, mostly just does what seems safe, won't win, doesn't deserve your support.

Other candidates:

Rand Paul- you probably already know about this guy.  Closer to conservative than his father, could unite the libertarians and conservatives.  Filibustered drone strikes on American citizens on American soil, favors less involvement abroad, got caught plagiarizing a speech (or column?).  Seems solid overall, the establishment is scared of him, which I love.

Marco Rubio- from Florida (swing state), was doing great until he pushed near-amnesty, then backed away from it.  Hispanic, and we Republicans will support any minority who shares our views that we can, just to prove we're not racist.  Definitely one to watch.

Bobby Jindal- has turned Louisiana around, but gave a terrible State of the Union rebuttal (Rubio did too).  Generally strikes me as a policy wonk- has gotten great results in Louisiana (school choice HELL YEAH), but doesn't seem to connect with people nationally. Another non-white candidate to support to prove our lack of racism.  Definitely one to watch.

Mitch Daniels- didn't want to run in 2008 or 2012, did good work in Indiana (swing state).  

Scott Walker- has already been through hell and back in Wisconsin, though recent email scandal doesn't look good.  Putting Wisconsin in play would be huge, and standing up to the unions was damn impressive.

Chris Christie- moderate on social issues, stood up to teacher's unions, maintains popularity despite taking a hard conservative line on many issues (in New Jersey!).  We'll see how he looks after the bridge scandal peters out.

Paul Ryan- has been writing the playbook for the Congressional Republicans on fiscal responsibility.  Maybe the "second place" from 2012? Definitely another guy to watch.  

Jeb Bush- would have been the 2008 nominee if his last name wasn't Bush.  But it is.  A popular Florida (swing state) Governor, with name recognition (and connections), who has focused on education reform since leaving office in 2007.  If he could get his brother's swagger and folksy appeal but walk\ back from his less popular stances, he'd be great.  

John Kasich- not as high profile as the other guys, but he's the Republican governor of Ohio (swing state).  

Rick Santorum- former Senator from Pennsylvania.  He might run, but his 2008 flameout was probably the end of being in serious contention.

Mike Huckabee- former Governor of Arkansas.  Same analysis as Santorum.

Peter King- Congressman from New York, doesn't like Rand Paul's isolationism.

Scott Brown- former Massachusetts Senator.  

Susana Martinez- New Mexico Governor (swing state), woman.

Kinda of a funny title there. Police have never needed a warrant to search your home, if you gave them consent first.

The case is Fernandez v. California, in case anyone is interested. There is no official citation yet since the case was decided so recently. If anyone uses Westlaw, this is their temporary cite: 2014 WL 700100. Here is a summation of the facts:

&gt;Police officers observed a suspect in a violent robbery run into an apartment building, and heard screams coming from one of the apartments. They knocked on the apartment door, which was answered by Roxanne Rojas, who appeared to be battered and bleeding. When the officers asked her to step out of the apartment so that they could conduct a protective sweep, petitioner came to the door and objected. Suspecting that he had assaulted Rojas, the officers removed petitioner from the apartment and placed him under arrest. He was then identified as the perpetrator in the earlier robbery and taken to the police station.

Here's a quote from the facts in the actual opinion of the court:

&gt;Approximately one hour after petitioner's arrest, Detective Clark returned to the apartment and informed Rojas that petitioner had been arrested. Detective Clark requested and received both oral and written consent from Rojas to search the premises. In the apartment, the police found Drifters gang paraphernalia, a butterfly knife, clothing worn by the robbery suspect, and ammunition. Rojas' young son also showed the officers where petitioner had hidden a sawed-off shotgun.

The quote that the article cites is erroneously out of context. This is what Justice Alito wrote just before that:

&gt; [It is a violation of fourth amendment rights] if “there is evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection.” 547 U.S., at 121, 126 S.Ct. 1515. We do not believe the statement should be read to suggest that improper motive may invalidate objectively justified removal. Hence, it does not govern here.

&gt;The Randolph dictum is best understood not to require an inquiry into the subjective intent of officers who detain or arrest a potential objector but instead to refer to situations in which the removal of the potential objector is not objectively reasonable.

&gt;. . .

&gt;He does not contest the fact that the police had reasonable grounds for removing him from the apartment so that they could speak with Rojas, an apparent victim of domestic violence, outside of petitioner's potentially intimidating presence. In fact, he does not even contest the existence of probable cause to place him under arrest. We therefore hold that an occupant who is absent due to a lawful detention or arrest stands in the same shoes as an occupant who is absent for any other reason.

In other words, the law hasn't changed. The Supreme Court isn't making it legal to search your home without consent. The court is simply saying that if they legally and lawfully arrest you, they are allowed to search the home if another legally responsible adult lives at the home and that person gives his or her consent to search the home.

Fernandez was hoping they would throw out the evidence they found by citing a case called Randolph from 2006. Randolph held that when multiple individuals live in the same apartment, police cannot search the home if one of them, who is physically present, denies the police entry. In other words, a single denial of entry, stated by someone physically there, will trump any amount of consent.

The police legally arrested Fernandez and took him to jail. They then returned to the home an hour later and asked Rojas, the woman who was battered and bleeding, if they could search the home. She agreed. Since Fernandez was not physically present, he could not object and the consent was valid.

Let's imagine a couple of different scenarios now. First, imagine that the police show up at the home when Fernandez is out doing other things. They ask Rojas if they can come in. She agrees. This is legal because they have the consent of the occupier of the premises.

Now, let's imagine that they knock on the door with no legal cause to arrest Fernandez. They ask if they can come in. Rojas says yes and Fernandez says no. The police cannot enter. If the police illegally arrest Fernandez and then go inside the home, then dictum in Randolph suggests that this would be a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.

The critical difference in this case is that Fernandez was arrested legally. He doesn't even deny that fact. When he was in prison and the police returned to the home, it was, logically, the same as if Fernandez was simply not home.

That's all that the court is saying.

&gt; A federal judge declared Texas' ban on gay marriage unconstitutional Wednesday. 

Good! It's liberty and justice for ALL, not just the ones you like/agree with. 
-----==----==---==-----
I think the state should get the fuck away from the entire concept of marriage, and just give out civil unions to everyone that wants one. 

If you wanna call it a marriage, call it a marriage. I'm sure you can find some church somewhere that can call anything a marriage. 

Regardless, odds are that no matter what the fuck you call it, it's gonna end in something that doesn't give a fuck if you're gay or straight, and that's divorce :(
-----==----==---==-----
If you still have hope that the country is going to turn around with a big win in 2014 and maybe in 2016, this proves that is pipe dream.  When liberals cannot legally legislate their agenda they simply find a liberal judge to impose their ideology.  
-----==----==---==-----
Once the Left has successfully forced every state to redefine the institution of marriage for the benefit of the five percent of the population that suffers from the paraphilia known as homosexuality, what then? 

I mean, activist groups don't just go away after they achieve their stated goal. The "civil rights" movement didn't go away after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Nope, then they demanded "affirmative action," aka government-mandated racial discrimination against whites. They got that, but the demands continued. The First Amendment ("hate speech") and Second Amendment (self defense is racist!) are both under assault. Reparations for slavery could be next. 

The women's rights movement started out just wanting the right to vote. Almost a century later, we see that the feminists are still with us, denouncing the "patriarchy" just as stridently, whining and complaining about seemingly everything. This, despite the fact that more women than men go to college, more women than men cast ballots in our elections, and men routinely get the short end of the stick in family court. Now they are going after "rape culture" (whatever that is) and alleged sexism in video games. Oh, and demanding free birth control. (Apparently that's another one of those "fundamental rights" that nobody noticed until now.)

So, what will the next step be for the homosexual lobby? Because they certainly aren't going away. And if you honestly believe that conservatives can avoid being called "homophobic hate-mongering bigots" simply by caving on this issue, you are in for an unpleasant surprise. 
-----==----==---==-----
Can we just keep marriage as a religious institution and let people have civil unions to their hearts content? Gays and Lesbians get their legal benefits and religious people can have their ceremony marriage with whatever that means for their denomination. Everyone wins except the people that have to rewrite all the laws to say Unioned instead of Married. That is probably the main hangup with that approach, as the idea of marriage is so entrenched into so many laws state, local, federal it probably isn't feasible. 

Either way, this doesn't bother me, and should just happen already to eliminate it as a topic of discussion. It's such small potatoes as far as issues go.

Or it could be that historically the six year midterm goes against the sitting president. Nine of the last ten have all seen heavy swings in favor of the other party with the only exception being Clinton in 98(one of the reasons the Clinton/Lewinsky thing being brought up again by Rand Paul is so confusing). There's no fancy policy things to look into, the minority party gains seats at the six year midterm. If Republicans don't gain at least 8.6(the average gain in the nine elections) seats in the senate they will have under performed.

You would have to be an idiot to compare Putin to a Conservative. He's a totalitarian dictator, the exact kind of person that Obama admires and envys. Putin is hardly going to support free markets and self determination. Putin is not going to allow his citizens the right to keep and bear arms. Putin is not going to allow free speech and defend the ability of people who don't agree with him to air their grievances in public.  

Putin is going to control his economy, repress his people, consolidate more power to his office, reward his friends and supporters and punish his enemies.  Does that sound familure?

Whether or not humans are the cause is irrelevant. We possess the technology to geo engineer the climate and we can choose what to put in or take it of the atmosphere, barring local government influences.

I think, even if we disagree on what causes climate change, we can agree that it isn't necessarily good and we can change that.

But I'm also hoping for a governor to emerge. I'd be willing to overlook a few policy disagreements in favor of someone who's actually held, and been successful in, a comparable job. I think Rand is a smart and generally competent person, but he's only ever run activist organizations and worked as a senator. I hate to say it but he's too much Obama's mirror image: an eloquent and intelligent activist that became a senator but has never held a significant executive position. I probably agree with him on more issues than any other candidate, but I'm craving proven competence right now, and after the on-the-job training fiasco of the current president I suspect a lot of less than fully conservative voters out there would agree with me.

I'm going to have disagree on her assessment that gun control helped a stalker kill her husband. She said herself that she knew he was a stalker, but figured he wasn't dangerous. When he was approached to leave, he shot ben once dropping him, then five more times while he was on the ground. 

That's pretty random. I'm pretty sure by the way she described the incident she had no idea that was about to happen. So hypothetically she wouldn't of been able to respond in time to save her husband. 

Even if she had her gun, the circumstances leading to her husband's death don't sound like they would change. The change would be more about what would happen after. 

Don't let my statements fool you though. I'm not about more gun control. I've recognized that most gun crimes committed are from guns owned illegally. I just think its not fair for her to blame gun control on a situation that really no one had control of. 
-----==----==---==-----
Freaky, I saw this exact story on the ID Discovery channel show on Obsession: Dark Desires last night. 

She had a gun and a permit, she fallowed the law and didn't bring the gun with her inside of the restaurant even though she had stalker problem. Her stalker didn't care about the law brought it in with him and used it to kill Ben. 

Granted, she having a fire arm with her would not guarantee that would stopped the stalker from killing Ben. She may have killed the stalker, but in the crowded restaurant there was a good chance she or the stalker would have skilled or injured a bystander. I know most GDU are situations where no shots were fired, merely drawing a gun in a lot of situations will stop a violent crime, however this individual is emotionally imbalanced and he was there to kidnap, rape, and murder (telling by the contents of his trunk of his car at the time of the arrest). He didn't care about consequences, if she drew the weapon he probably would have fired irregardless. It could have made the situation worse. 

That does not mean gun control works either, that gun free zone on the restaurant did not stop that man from bringing a gun unside to begin with and it did not prevent Ben's death. Criminals don't care what the law says, they don't care if the government declared a building a gun free zone, it is why they are criminals in first place. The idea that someone is packing heat would deter a lot of criminals. Criminals, in general, don't want a fight. They want an easy target to prey on. They want to get in, do what ever it is they want to do, and then get away cleanly and quickly as possible. Having an armed individual there means there is more risk of being killed, injured, or captured by law enforcement.

&gt;My husband Ben and I ran our mobile karaoke business out of a restaurant that served alcohol and my gun was forbidden there.

Is there anyone who genuinely wants a lack of restriction of gun posession... in areas that serve alcohol?

What bothers me is that this bill is in response to actual harassment by the extreme left trying to compel people into celebrating their lifestyle. No business will refuse gays; what they may refuse to do is be compelled to partake in a gay marriage. Birthday cakes for gay folks? Sure. Photos of a graduation of a gay person? Absolutely. Endorsing gay marriage by taking part in it? No. It's not refusing service to a class of people, it's refusing to perform a class of service.
-----==----==---==-----
So the sign that reads 'We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone' really means 'We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone, but you can still sue us for exercising that right'.  
-----==----==---==-----
There is no logical rebuttal to this. Anyone who is comparing having someone refusing to make them a cake to someone being beaten or shot for their skin color during the civil rights movement really needs to self reflect.
-----==----==---==-----
Businesses have always had the right to choose who they do business with. The reason this never comes up is because businesses want to make as much money as possible. The free market quickly stamps out a business that is selective of their customers. 
-----==----==---==-----
I haven't read the Arizona Law here, so it may be vague and poorly written to protect those businesses who wish not to participate in events with which they fundamentally disagree. A business should not be allowed to discriminate against people for race, sex or even sexual preference. A local diner does not have the right to refuse service of lunch or dinner to someone simply because they're gay. Nobody is advocating for this. It is possible this law was written to allow for this type of obvious discrimination.

A cake maker, photographer or caterer does not have the right to refuse service to customers simply because they are gay. In other words, a baker cannot refuse to bake a cake for a birthday or retirement party for someone who is gay. A photographer should not be allowed to refuse to take graduation or family portraits of gay subjects. That would be discrimination and should be made illegal.

However, a baker, photographer, caterer, etc. should not be forced to participate in an **event** with which they fundamentally disagree. A gay wedding is an event that many do not agree with. The full force of law should not compel businesses to have the option of either participating in an event they do not condone or face lawsuits and/or fines from government. A catholic photographer should be able to refuse to photograph a wedding that is not in a Catholic church if they so chose. A Baptist wedding planner should be able to refuse to plan weddings of a couple who are already cohabitating. These are not examples of discrimination, just as refusing to participate in a gay wedding is not.

So if it isn't already written in the Law, specific language should be put in to differentiate between refusing gays in general and refusing to participate in a gay wedding.

The comparison of Jews and Nazi rallies is insane and insulting, other than that this article might be right. I actually live in this fine city, I don't know who find this stuff but I haven't seen or heard this on the news at all. I don't think anybody is caring about this issue.

I'm a gay wedding photographer and no one forces me to shoot religious celebrations. If I didn't want to work with someone because they were in-my-face-religious, I wouldn't tell them. I would be a savvy and tactful businessman and a place the blame on a mismatch in style or desired outcome (Which would be true--I'm not interested in creating religiously themed artwork), and I would direct them to someone I think would satisfy them.

Sexual orientation is going to be a protected class, give it 10 or 20 years. There's not going to be a way around that. And just to be clear, if there's some big gay conspiracy to bring that about, I haven't been invited to any of the meetings.

I've worked my entire career around sensitivities to this kind of stuff. I don't want to shoot for every couple that calls me, and not every couple wants a gay photographer at their wedding. It's made me more shrewd. I think the sooner businesses stop letting personal feelings be the iron law of their business practices the better. Everyone of the businesses effected by this would have a better time if instead of pointing at their feelings about this or that, they kept their mouth shut, looked at the markets they do and do not want to attract, then structured their business for success in those markets.

The bill is a bad idea because the state shouldnt get involved in sponsoring these sorts of action based on religious views.

The Free Market will destroy this stupid bill.  Apple is considering pulling a plant out of AZ. Stupid bakeries can continue to refuse service to gay people, but then be destroyed by the free market.

-----==----==---==-----
Dotz-N-Bubbles, this question is specifically for you:

I don't like White people. Any of them. I refuse service to any white person who tries to buy things from me, but will gladly make deals with Latinos, Blacks, and Asians.

Is this discrimination? 

If so, what's the difference between discriminating on race and discriminating on sexual orientation?
-----==----==---==-----
Freedom of association. Imagine that.
-----==----==---==-----
No one should be forced to do business with anyone, regardless of anything (remember "no shirt, no shoes, no service?"). More importantly, why would you want to force someone to do a job for you? Why risk getting bad service or a bad product by forcing the business to serve you? The AZ law appears to be as sloppy and absurd as the victimized argument on the other side. Isn't the idea of free enterprise a two-way street?
-----==----==---==-----
That's actually a very interesting perspective.

People do that all the time in the military. Wait in your car, wait in the building, wherever. Lots of people wait until the flag is lowered.
-----==----==---==-----
This is nothing unusual.  Running inside right before colors is a common occurrence on Marine Corps bases.  When it happens twice a day, every day, a lot of people start seeing having to stand there at attention as an annoyance.  It's commonly joked about too, just go check the top posts over at /r/usmc, I guarantee there will be some jokes about it.


-----==----==---==-----
Former Marine here........can confirm, we ALL did it. 

We still joke about it. The absolute mad dash to get inside a building whenever the trumpet would sound in order to bring people to attention for the evening colors ceremony. It's almost a Marine cliche. 

It got really ridiculous when we were overseas. Then you'd have to hold your salute for morning raising of the base flag for the American National Anthem.......AND the host country's national anthem too. Japan was ridiculous. Their national anthem, I swear to God, was like 10 minutes long. I was in phenomenal shape back then.........but by the end my friggin arm hurt from holding it up for so long. 

So yeah......you hear the 'colors trumpet' you dash, dive, run over people, scramble as fast as you can to make it inside a covered building somewhere. If you're in a car, you're simply supposed to just stop and wait until the colors ceremony is over before you can drive again. 

This is much ado about nothing from civilians that don't understand some of the nuances of being a junior enlisted service memeber.

-----==----==---==-----
Because sadly, most media, is only interested in presenting their point of view, and anyone who doesn't slant their news towards that point of view is viewed as evil.

Most media hasn't been clear and unbiased for decades. So most liberals are used to seeing their view point, as the only voice.

Now with Fox News, which actually presents many points of view, is seen as evil, because it doesn't only present the one voice or one view.

But in the end this is really a sign of the lack of class and character of other people. 

If you can not respect those who disagree with you, and can not tolerate dissent, then it is clear they only tolerate tyranny.

For me Voltairre said it best.

"I may disagree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."
-----==----==---==-----
The problem is that fox (and msnbc) are not news channels, they are entertainment channels. They only cater to already formed pre conceived notions that are often false. This is why conservatives were so shocked mitt Romney got beat like he did. To anyone not watching fox it was pretty clear he ran a terrible campaign and was not going to win. These propaganda channels just want to manipulate you into religious devotion to them because you agree with them. They don't care about news or about you. This is why studies and surveys have consistently shown that people who primarily get their news from Fox are the last informed people in the country (fox usually comes in last msnbc  usually a very close second), even more uninformed than people who get their news from Facebook. They also consistently show that about 75% of fox broadcasting and 85% of msnbc broadcasting is opinion, not fact. The best thing for you to do is get your news from a news station, not a propaganda station. This will require that you be willing to recognize some of your conservative ideologies are wrong, but you will actually become informed and you will be glad you did.

Lord Acton said it so long ago.

"Absolute Power, Corrupts Absolutely".

When our nation was running smoothly, and there were no major problems of any kind, well politicians want to be re-elected, so they had to be endlessly creating new laws and solving problems even if there was no real reason for those.

So politicians, and we voting for politicians who do nothing productive, helped make our once great nation, a simple, lazy socialist, welfare state, just like in Sochi or Detroit.

Where barely anything works, only people who get paid well are those in power, most people barely able to afford food and shelter, but dependent on the government for their hand outs.

As a conservative, I found this hard to watch. I understand Hannity's point about trying to get this guy to confess to wide sweeping generalizations about the media right...but IMO Hannity was rude in the extreme. Ask the question, and allow him to give the best answer he can, and THEN tear him apart for his nonsensical views. I couldn't understand the opposing viewpoint, merely because Hannity kept interrupting him constantly. 

It's no wonder some people get the idea that we are divisive and hateful. Please, Sean, consider a little honey to go with the vinegar.  
-----==----==---==-----
Hannity comes across as immature at times, which bugs me. (Take his feud with Alec Baldwin, for example) However, this candidate came across as a child. He's definitely not ready for prime time.

Actual informed liberals know the tea party isn't racist; they just think they are an extremist group with crazy views. Relative to their own views, they are extremist. Politicians aren't playing to this crowd. They are playing to the "I know more about the Kardashians than I do the US government." crowd.

It's never really been about gays, except in that if it can be struck down it provides a weapon by which one may compel the religious to violate their values. Pretty sickening.
-----==----==---==-----
To take the used example of a baker making a cake for a gay wedding, this law could be used to refuse service to a mixed race wedding as well, since one's religious beliefs could support the idea that race mixing is wrong. Or one could refuse service to a wedding in which the couple has been married previously - such can be also against the Bible.  Perhaps a Muslim family wouldn't cater a wedding due to some interpretation of the Koran. The list can go on and on, because this law is too open-ended and is begging to be abused. It's a poor law and it will create a hostile climate in the state with lawsuits abound.

I also work for 11 bucks an hour supporting me and my wife, 520 rent, 90 for my insurance, 50 for tv/internet, 50 phone and about 200 for groceries a month. Those burger flippers can crawl under houses 5-6 days a week and see how they'd like it if some burger flipper demanded to be paid more than my job.

The liberals in this country have not only created a entire generation dependent upon government but worse, they created a culture where there's no shame in being dependent upon government.

-----==----==---==-----
Short answer, its way too unpopular to suggest.  Ron Paul was the only guy in the 2012 primaries who suggested it, and look how that turned out (not that this one issue was the reason, but you get my drift).

Also another point, if you just lowered it right now, you would actually increase unemployment.  People would stop working and move onto government handouts.  If you're only going to be paid $4/hour, bus fare + lunch.( if you don't have the opportunity to bring something from home) could be nearly a 1/3 to half of your daily pay (couple bucks each way for the bus, 5 bucks for lunch etc).  Thats not enough to come close to surviving, so you would logically just move onto food stamps/welfare etc.

Now if that was combined with a complete overhaul of the benefit system currently in place, maybe, but the government can barely function let alone change all of the above, so its pretty impractical to suggest (at this time).
-----==----==---==-----
The minimum wage has never been about jobs....A minimum wage job isn't a job at all. You will have people who argue its the bare minimum someone needs to survive, its not even close to that, As rabblerousereturn mentioned so eloquently it really is a indicator of inflation. As the minimum wage never truly goes up, it remains constant.......US currency is devalued. We could do far more by keeping the minimum wage what it is and deflating our currency by paying off our debt and returning to more tangible methods of wealth-----&gt; this is a pipe dream I wish we could accomplish but we have to stop our government spending money like a 13 year old girl at a shopping mall with daddy's credit card.
-----==----==---==-----
Simply put, it'd absolutely get shut down.  No questions asked.  Especially considering a Gallup poll showed 50% of Repubs are for raising minimum wage to $9 an hour:  http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/20/sharp-divisions-in-gop-base-on-raising-the-minimum-wage/

If you have 50% Republicans for upping it, you'll have even fewer cool with lowering it.  And unfortunately, for so many low paying jobs in the service sector wages would all go down in unison.  Up and leaving a low paying service job wouldn't work, because all of the others wouldn't pay crap either.  The good ones would be taken too quickly for too many people to find one in a reasonable time.  

Not to mention lowering it would put it dangerously close to the poverty line.  Going below $5.50 would result in literally minimum wage being a poverty wage for a single adult at 40 hours a week.  No way can a first world nation like America get away with that.

&gt; They care about propagating the ideology of oppression and victimhood, eg "these evil capitalists are oppressing me by not offering me a higher hourly wage!" And as we all know, victimhood sells to the ignorant masses AKA the majority of Democrats.

Almost a 25% child poverty rate and bloated top earners' paychecks really sides with the president here.  The rhetoric that the poor are lazy and just meander through life only hurts people, it doesn't do anything but negatively enforce inequality.  Do you really think deriding poor people as doles and desiring to push wages lower solves anything?

-----==----==---==-----
Liberals tend to argue that the people who lose jobs are a smaller group than those who are "raised out of poverty" with the increased wages. Their argument goes that if these people are getting payed more they will spend more and in the long run they'll eventually create more jobs. Sounds like BS to me but that's what I keep getting told by leftists when I object to raising the minimum wage.
-----==----==---==-----
Better still if we eliminate the minimum wage. Let the tide of free markets determine wage levels and empower the worker to stake a claim for his or her own self value. It would employ untold thousands of unemployed youths immediately.

I used to have much respect for Dr. Kaku.

&gt;Dr Kaku:  So it's good to present the balance, but you have to say that, with 95 percent of the scientific community behind this **theory**, it has more weight than another **theory**.

A 'theory' is not settled science until the scientific method can prove the 'theory' in a repeatable way.

But it cannot be scientifically proven, or the 25 plus years of computer models would not all be wrong, resulting in the last warming estimate from AR-5 being nothing better than a 'best guess' at what temps are going to do, and far below any previous computer models.

I wasnt charged with anything, however I did experience an incident somewhat like this while attending a Merc U. course in Missouri a few years back.

The course was held in a building that also had tech skills classes for the local high school taking place at the same time.

Our adult classes started at 7:00 in the morning so we were always first to arrive and we took the choice parking spots .
It seems this really upset the high school classes teachers, who upon walking past our vehicles must have gave them a good look over, because one of them spotted a spent 12 gauge shotgun shell that was laying in the bed of my pickup.

As unbelievable as it may be, this was enough for libtards to go into a full idiot frenzy over !

The police were called, and next thing I know I am being escorted out of class by an officer wanting to talk to me about my vehicle.

The officer was a nice fella and knew I was no terrorist or kid killer , however he did have to make an appearance that he was doing his job to make the tards happy.

We chatted for a bit and he kindly explained what had happened and how there was a no tolerance policy for fire arms or even ammo on school grounds, so he needed to search my vehicle, which I had no prob with I had nothing to hide.

He apologised for the hassle and said even he thought that going bonkers over a spent shell was pretty damn stupid, he then gave me the shell and asked I keep it out of sight so the tards wouldnt go bonkers again, and with that I went back to class, and he went back to work.

&gt; When did the strategy become, “Get the government to force them to take my money, damn it!” 

Probably since the 14th Amendment with the Equal Protection Clause.  It's the basis for the decision in Brown v Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and more importantly to this instance, Romer v Evans.  But there are a quite a few people on this subreddit much more knowledgeable about the constitution than I, so I'll let them chime in on the details.  But this would be my guess:

Holder should be thrown out for other things than Gay marriage stance. He has so many skeletons in his closet it looks like Cambodian labor camp.
-----==----==---==-----
Alright, here is where I disagree with this whole thing. 

Do you run a business? If so then, no you should not be able to discriminate against homosexuals. This situation is often compared to being black and the usual response is but they aren't black its not about race! While being gay may not be a race, you have a very hard and long fight trying not to argue that people are not born gay. I don't believe a business should be able to deny service against a person simply for the way they were born. If two dudes come in and want a large wanker on their cake for their wedding, sure. Its vulgar. If two dude come in and want a cake with the words "congrats" on it, no. If you are religious and run a business you still have to play by the rules that everyone else plays by. 

This whole baloney with "it's gonna wind up with preachers being sued for not performing same sex marriages" is well, baloney. Are the ministers running a business? Is it the Presbyterian Church on Fifth Street? Well, I don't think that's a business. Does he run a marriage chapel in vegas? Well, that's a business. 

See the distinction? If you make cakes out of your kitchen for fun, discriminate away. If you run a business play by the rules that everyone else does. Or should Atheists be able to turn away religious customers?

Part of this argument by liberals gets driven purely by emotion and class envy. They paint a picture of some rich CEO thats keeping all the company's profits for themselves. The reality is companies with a lot of minimum wage employees run very low profit margins. McDonalds may make a ton of money but its because there are so many of them, chances are if you forced them to bump up their wages they'd either have to raise the price of food or layoff people in order to stay profitable.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;what happened to low-wage earners the last time we raise the minimum wage?

They are all rich now, of course. 
-----==----==---==-----
Democrats don't care, even if a bi-partisan investigation concluded it will create a loss of jobs. Because it's about ideology. The minimum wage needs to be hiked, and right now, to show the "1%" and make a statement. If a few poor schmucks lose their jobs over it, oh well. For the greater good, and they should feel happy they lost their job for the right reason.

Also being unemployed isn't a big deal. They can just go on welfare!

Not sure if this makes a difference to any of you, but because all of these eligible immigrants received deferred action, that means:

* 100% of them have legitimate social security cards/numbers and can work legally and pay income tax
* 100% of them have passed a recent background check
* 100% of them came to the United States before the age of 16.

I'm not sure how /r/conservative feels about people in this situation, but there's no denying that it's pretty shitty to be one of these people, considering they likely had no say in how they got here, and their status is a result of their parents' negligence. 

Also, this number represents about 1% of all undocumented immigrants in the country, and it's only in one particular state (CA). The article says that it is a specific law which passed in California that allows this, not the ACA.

Section 1312 (f)(3) of Obamacare:

&gt; Access limited to lawful residents. If an individual is not, or is not reasonably expected to be for the entire period for which enrollment is sought, a citizen or national of the United States or an alien lawfully present in the United States, the individual shall not be treated as a qualified individual and may not be covered under a qualified health plan in the individual market that is offered through an Exchange.

The NFL cares about money.  Just like any business in the free market.  And they care about their employees and staff.  
-----==----==---==-----
So I'm not sure I see the point here. How exactly is this infringing on religious freedoms? 

The law in question here is just cookie cutting the bible, it's not going to fully enforce it. I mean sure private business owners are entitled to their own opinions and beliefs. 

But in theory through a capitalist market shouldn't a business owner be entitled to maximize profits? Well again in theory anyway the only way to truly maximize profits of a business in general is to have a high pool of consumers, and like em or not but die hard liberals, and the sorts are part of that consumer pool and love to throw money around. 

So while you may not agree you have to ask yourself. What is better a feel good "reiligous freedom" law, or maximizing profits for your local businesses?
-----==----==---==-----
one of the major changes in the law is to extend the coverage of the law to corporate entities. so while the NFL likely has nothing against special selection of customers by some small business, they do perhaps worry about discriminatory policies held by franchise partners, who may discriminate at a stadium location or something. NFL just trying to avoid scandal most likely.

This title is misleading. Harvard is a private school, not a public university, so it can actually limit its students' and staff's speech as it sees fit. Nothing in the article called for any kind of litigious action to alter the First Amendment. Instead, it seemed to be a call upon students and staff to protest against research that holds racial or other biases. This is not a First Amendment issue.

With the same certainty that the sun will rise in the East tomorrow, it is always less expensive to take care of a patient at home than in the hospital.  In addition to the cuts in labor for taking care of the ill at home to keep them out of the hospital, obamacare has drastically cut the reimbursement for medical equipment that the patient needs to use in the home environment.  Within a year almost half of all those companies that provide home medical equipment will be out of business and their former employees unemployed.  

I used to think that obama was just pushing his commie agenda.  But in addition to that he is actually incredibly stupid.  A business person always looks at the big picture.  "If we change this....what other changes will occur."  Barry is so dumb that he thinks he can just make changes without other downstream effects.  But would you really expect anything less from a narcissistic community organizer who never had a real job in his life.  With a spouse who had a very nice paying hospital administrative job.  A job so important that when she quit, her position was totally eliminated.

Nixon/watergate isn't a good comparison. Nixon was out of his mind, I really don't think there is/was a conspiracy to Benghazi. It was pure negligence that resulted in americans dying and still is a perfect example of Obama hiring people who don't give two shits about their job. Hill-dog could have cared less what happened there.

Blaming it on a random youtube video that had little to no views prior the attack was cop out to try and rapidly shift the blame off Hillary and the state department.

Ironically I actually agreed with her on the "What difference does it make" comment she made. It really doesn't make any difference at all. She got americans killed simply because she didn't do her job and didn't make a difference......Nothing will bring them back. All we can do is hope americans see her for what she really is, and remember that stupid fing ad of hers with her picking up the phone at 2AM which she throughly proved she is incapable of doing.

Studies have come to light that state extended solitary  confinement inflicts mental abuse &amp; should be considered cruel &amp; unusual punishment. Thoughts? 
-----==----==---==-----
The Eighth Amendment is a good example of where arguments for originalist and textualist interpretations of the Constitution begin to break down for me. 

If you are more inclined toward interpreting the Constitution via original intent, consider what the Founding Fathers considered to be "cruel and unusual punishment": pillory, public torture and humiliation, forcing you into lifelong debt over excessive bail and fines, etc. All cruel and unusual, no doubt, but that is a given these days. But to the best of my knowledge, none of the Founding Fathers were explicitly opposed to something like the death penalty, yet the ethics and practicality of the death penalty are almost always debated within the context of the 8th Amendment. An originalist would most likely argue that the death penalty is not "cruel and unusual punishment," as it was a common practice during the 18th century, whereas many pragmatists and moralists would argue that it is, given its permanence and the inherent inequality in how it has been implemented.  

So first, regardless of the merits and drawbacks of the death penalty, I don't think anyone could legitimately deny that such a debate over it is not warranted.

Textualists fail here because descriptors like "excessive," "cruel," and "unusual" are so incredibly subjective and ambiguous. A literal interpretation of the amendment doesn't really tell you what is and isn't an acceptable form of punishment. The amendment might as well say "don't do bad things" without spelling out what bad things are. 

To me, the 8th Amendment is a good example of where strict textualism and original intent fall short, so I buy into the pragmatic approach that our standards and norms concerning criminal justice are and should continue to evolve past what our Founding Fathers intended. We simply know more about the subject nowadays than they did, and we're in a position as a society to figure out what the most effective form of punishment is. 

I believe one of the primary goals of our criminal justice system should be to lower the rate of recidivism and to transform convicts (particularly younger ones who still have a future ahead of them) into functioning members of society, which our current prison system is horribly failing at. My point is: if we have the evidence to suggest that something like solitary confinement is ineffective at rehabilitating prisoners or preventing them from committing more crimes once they are released, then we should scrap solitary confinement not only because it's an ineffective form of punishment, but because punishment should serve a greater purpose that benefits the criminal and the society he belongs to. If it doesn't, it's probably cruel and unusual. 
-----==----==---==-----
I am looking forward to the 10th.
-----==----==---==-----
It says that we can't have cruel AND unusual punishment. Does this mean that we can have cruel OR unusual punishment. 
-----==----==---==-----
Naive people seem to think "cruel and unusual punishment" is defined by "would you want that done to you?" I really wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life stuck in a prison with no chance of freedom. That doesn't mean prison time is cruel and unusual punishment. Cruel and unusual is excessive punishment. For instance instead of getting a speeding ticket you spend 10 years in prison (assuming that was your only offense).

This obviously requires context for any specific case. Can capital punishment be cruel and unusual? Yes, if it is hardly warranted for the crime committed. 
-----==----==---==-----
Gimmedat culture is the defining political phenomena of America now. Democrats have embraced it while Republicans ironically enough still maintain some semblance of the days of Kennedy's "ask not what your country can do for you" (can you imagine the outrage if a President said this today?). GOP calling for an end to the parasitic lifestyle that dominates so much of America is a big reason they won't be able to win elections in the future.

I started making bullets. less than 1000 dollars to get started. 

100 boxes with 50 bullets per at 20 dollars a box....2,000$

If you meet my personal quota of 700 boxes..Thats 14,000 dollars. 

Making money in this country is like failing in high school...Our system makes it very hard to be absolutely poor, If you don't have talents, You will always have work ethic. 

People need to give themselves more credit than being serviceable employees their whole life. How many of you can run a better business than your workplace? Think about that. No one likes the idea of starting at the bottom with a mountain of risk awaiting...But fuck it, We are unemployed anyways!

The boomers are retiring and there aren't enough skilled tradesmen to replace them, the demand is about to skyrocket. If you are scared of breaking a sweat, you don't deserve to be employed. Every state has training programs to get people into these jobs at no cost to the individual. 

A Journeyman Carpenter makes $38 an hour. Electricians make $44-52 an hour. (In Alaska anyways) Those are likely to increase as demand increases.

I don't think it's a debate as to whether or not Obama is 'educated'. He has the sheepskin to prove it. 

Like many people, Obama is 'educated' well past his actual level of intelligence. That's why he mispronounces words and gets little things wrong like '57' states. He's a man who spent his educational career falling up based mostly on his race, and most likely his status as an 'international student'. 

'Educated' and 'intelligent' are two very different things. Obama is one of those things, and it's not 'intelligent'. 
-----==----==---==-----
Not all majors are equal. Ethnic Studies compared to Law School is not really equivalent. I have met some *really* dumb people with PHDs. Isn't Ethnic Studies a Bachelor of Arts degree?

This is no defense of Obama. He is "educated" in the sense that he went through college and Law School. But let's be realistic, he was a C average student in his Bachelor's degree and was accepted into Harvard Law... This was during the 70's. Bush had a higher GPA than Obama. I wouldn't say he is dumb, but he definitely is not a highly intelligent man like the left was insistent about during the 2008 election.

Once again, Buchanan hits the nail right on the head.  

&gt; A radical idea: Suppose we repealed the civil rights laws and fired all the bureaucrats enforcing these laws. Does anyone think hotels, motels and restaurants across Dixie, from D.C. to Texas, would stop serving black customers? Does anyone think there would again be signs sprouting up reading “whites” and “colored” on drinking foundations and restrooms? Does anyone think restrictive covenants against Jews would be rewritten into contracts on houses? Does anything think that bars and hotels would stop serving blacks and Hispanics?
&gt;    
&gt;In his indictment of George III, Jefferson wrote of the king: “He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.” Is that not what we have today in spades? Why do we need this vast army of bureaucrats? They exist to validate the slander that America is a racist, sexist, homophobic and xenophobic country which would revert to massive discrimination were it not for heroic progressives standing guard.

The so-called 'marriage equality' movement does themselves a huge disservice by using the courts to bully photographers, bakers, churches, and others who do not wish to participate in their gay wedding. 

I'm all for gay marriage - even as a conservative. Get married. Great for y'all. 

But stop bullying people into accepting something that they don't want to. The photographer you want to hire is a bigot? Big whoopty doo. Go to the next one. There's hundreds of them in your area. Don't be such a big baby about it. A baker doesn't want to make your big gay cake? Fuck it. Call a different baker, you fucking toddler.

Using the courts as a means of making people accept your lifestyle when they clearly never will is counterproductive to your cause, gay people. It makes you look petty and immature. If you wish for people to respect your lifestyle and beliefs, perhaps you could start by respecting the rights of others to hold a contrary opinion.

I work at a hospital, in the ER, and the number of people who say "I ain't got money, I need to sign me up for that uh,...Obamacare thing. Can you do that for me?" at which point, I say, with a serious yet helpful face and eye rolling in my heart "Well you understand that the healthcare exchange is just a place for you to go and buy health insurance. You'll still be responsible for a monthly premium - depending on your income level you *may* get a subsidy, so you should absolutely go look - However after you pay the monthly amount, you're still personally responsible for the cost of any copays or co insurance. So even under the "Obamacare", you'll still need to pay out of pocket for your medical care. Which means that even once you sign up, and pay your monthly premium, when you come here or go to the doctor's office, you will be asked for money. But like I said, you may qualify for a subsidy to reduce the amount of the monthly premium! So you absolutely have to go look. The Website is ....Now, what can you leave as a good faith deposit on your visit today?"

I love Obamacare. Love it, love it, love it. I've been a proud, card carrying member of the "I pay for my own shit" club since I can remember. I cannot begin to recount the number of times I've sat in a hospital with my wife watching twenty something meth head tweakers come in for their $30k in free services to shoot out another accidental pay check...er...I mean child, on the State Health Care Plan subsidized by me no less, only to have *the privilege* of a hefty bill from the hospital (after the insurance, copays, etc. I already pay) further subsidizing their *free* services in the form of inflated costs for those rendered to me. 

Shove that shit down their throat until they choke on the debt, their eyeballs bulge, and they cry for forgiveness, then give them more. I've had the privilege of choking on their shit my entire life because I was so naive as to think *my hard work* would actually benefit me (I'm making more money so why are my checks getting smaller....?). It's nice to know they get to enjoy the suck, too. 

In fact we should modify the bill so that Gold (or Platinum or Obamium level whatever) Tier plans are the only options available, so maybe for once in their life they can know what it feels like to have everything they've "earned" (LOL, I know) taken away from them routinely, like it's nothing.

-----==----==---==-----
Racism in America is better thought of in terms of geography than in political affiliation. The Republican party's stronghold used to be in the Northeast and Democrats controlled the South. Those roles were substantially reversed within just a couple of decades, but the demographics and beliefs of those states had changed little.

The Dixiecrat schism of 1948 is perhaps the beginning of the shift. Truman signed an executive order desegregating the military and civil rights support was inserted into the Democratic party platform. This angered Southern Democrats who formed their own splinter party that ran on a segregationist platform with Strom Thurmond as their nominee. They won in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina.

LBJ further angered Southern Democrats with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. By the time of the 1964 election, Strom Thurmond had to switch his affiliation to Republican in order to maintain his Senate seat. The Presidential election was a landslide in favor of LBJ, handily beating Republican opponent Barry Goldwater. Besides Goldwater's home state of Arizona, the only states he won were the Dixiecrat states and Georgia. The reason? His opposition to the Civil Rights Act.

Although Goldwater opposed the CRA based on his libertarian beliefs and had integrated hiring practices in his business, racist Southerners were single-issue voters and weren't concerned with the particulars of his philosophy. After voting for segregationist splinter candidate George Wallace in 68, the South finally broke for the Republican party in 72. Although Carter was able to bring the "Solid South" back together in the 76 election, those racist Southerners were fully solidified into the Republican party during the 80s.

I learned that most conservatives are farther right than the liberals claim to be. I also became very aware of the difference between government enforced "safety" (right) and individual freedom (actual left).
-----==----==---==-----
I think you'd like John Goldberg's book Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas. (I think that's the subtitle). The left thrives on cliches, because they're intellectually vapid and afraid to admit the true foundation of their ideology and what their ideology has caused. They'll tell you your mind should change radically, but what they're implying is you should be a radical leftist. 

Glad to hear your mind did change radically -- in the right direction.

Are medical marijuana cards not protected under HIPAA?

What's to stop the government from denying or rescinding conceal-to-carry permits to people prescribed pain medication or stimulants for ADHD/narcolepsy both of which are controlled substances available with a prescription?

While this is a tricky situation, it's basically identical to the weed situation. The Feds could theoretically come and arrest anyone who has a marijuanna card, the same asthey could arrest gun owners with a card. I dont think the Feds will confiscate guns from weed card holders for the inevitable shit storm it will bring

We all agree in regulating guns. It's just a matter of what that regulation looks like. No one wants a drunk teenager running around with a rocket launcher. But as with everything there's a gray area. And that's where the debate comes in. 

Many liberals tend to live in larger cities. So their main exposure to guns is crime. And often violent crime. 

Many conservatives tend to live in more rural areas where there are no close by neighbors to call the cops if they see something going on near your house. There is no strength in numbers there. Guns are a legitimate form of protection. Not to mention recreation. But the reality is that guns are much less likely to be used in criminal behavior here. (Raw numbers.)


So with these two wildly different different personal experiences you can see how both groups come across their viewpoints honestly.  We just need to figure out a way that we can all agree on that addresses both these realities.

Liberal logic:  

-  Living on your own and not requiring the government for sustenance is illegal.

-  Entering the country illegally, using false federal identification, using government sustenance fraudulently for personal gain, and being, well, an illegal alien... is a Constitutional right!

This is a really sensationalized title.

&gt;Part of the conflict: She must hook up to the water system, although officials acknowledge she does not have to use it... “Reasonableness and code requirements don’t always go hand-in-hand … given societal and technical changes (that) requires review of code ordinances,” Eskin was quoted as saying.
Eskin’s remarks indicate that he views the code as both obsolete and unreasonable and in need of change. Yet he felt he had to enforce it.
The city did overstep its authority and may have violated due process procedures, Eskin noted. He felt that the city had not given Speronis proper notice of violations and ruled that some of the charges against her were unfounded... It is not known what action the city will take but city officials told Fernandez that they would be willing to let Speronis stay in her home if conditions are “sanitary.” At the hearing, Eskin noted that city officials have not actually been in Speronis’s home to make that determination.

Basically, this woman disconnected all the utilities from her home in an experiment to live off-grid, and she was doing fine until she did a TV interview where she talked about her experiment. The local municipal code requires all homes to have a water connection. Some city official saw the piece, and he served her an eviction notice the next day without any investigation. This is mostly a story of local bureaucrats with their heads up their own asses. They did at least acknowledge that she didn't have to actually use the water connection.

Top comment on [the actual Crimson editorial](http://www.thecrimson.com/column/the-red-line/article/2014/2/18/academic-freedom-justice/?page=single#)

&gt;Instead of summoning the thought police, the proper way to combat offensive research is to disprove it. That may take a bit more effort than just whining in The Crimson, but ultimately it is how we progress as a society.

&gt;Governments during Galileo's time tried to suppress offensive research. For the sake of humanity, I'm quite glad they didn't succeed.

I would say the reason are the same today as they were back then. To ensure loyalty to this country and no others. If you, as a Canadian, were to become president our foreign policy would probably suddenly become more pro-Canadian because of your ties with Canada... which may not be the most beneficial way to go for our country.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't really think that it's important - if for whatever reason the issue came to a popular vote, I would probably vote to amend it to some form of "Must have US citizenship". But it's not really a big issue for me - I wouldn't vote against someone if they were for it. And I'm generally a "Law and Order" person, so I think it's important to enforce the rule until it's amended.


I'm also probably biased because I'm a naturalized US citizen.

According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule, most black Americans do have some white admixture, so Obama is correct.

This is a pretty stupid argument, as Obama wasn't using the term in a derogatory manner and Nugent clearly was. Obama wasn't attacking anyone for their racial heritage.

-----==----==---==-----
In short,

Only  37% of meteorologists who did not make a living writing published papers supported man made global warming. 
48% of all meteorologists did not believe in man made global warming. 
-----==----==---==-----
The survey's authors made 4 hypotheses that they would test to see their predictive ability for the following three questions; 

1. Is GW real?
2. Do humans cause it?
3. How harmful will it be?

The four hypotheses that they expected to predict the answers to those three questions were:

&gt; 1. As compared with professionals with less expertise in climate change, professionals with more expertise will have higher levels of personal certainty that global warming is happening, will be more likely to view it is as mostly human-caused, and will be more likely to view it as harmful rather than beneficial. 

&gt; 2. As compared with professionals with a more conservative political orientation, professionals with a more liberal political orientation will have higher levels of personal certainty that global warming is happening, will be more likely to be view it is as mostly human-caused, and will be more likely to view it as harmful rather than beneficial. 

&gt; 3. As compared with professionals who perceive less scientific consensus about global warming, professionals who perceive more scientific consensus will have higher levels of personal certainty that global warming is happening, will be more likely to be view it as mostly human-caused, and will be more likely to view it as harmful rather than beneficial. 

&gt; 4. As compared with professionals who perceive less conflict about global warming within the membership base of their professional society, professionals who perceive more conflict will report lower levels of personal certainty that global warming is happening, will be less likely to be view it is as mostly human-caused, and less likely to view it as harmful rather than beneficial. 

The authors sent an email survey to all the listed members, and had a 26% response rate. 

Since this is a pre-publication draft, you can't see the tables, but they should provide an interesting breakout. 


-----==----==---==-----
Wow.   64% of people liked this without apparently reading the link to the original study.   No where in  the  original study does it mention 63% of "weather predictors"  are global warming skeptics.

I don't oppose her because she is a woman.  I oppose her because her politics is moronic.  I want Condi Rice to run.  I don't agree with everything she wants but I am looking forward to seeing how the left deals with a very smart woman with well thought out, oppositional viewpoints.
-----==----==---==-----
The fact that Obama and Hillary are idiots has nothing to do with their race or sex.  Though you can't tell that to the left...they refuse to accept it.

This picture embodies 90% of the democratic strategy. They don't have anything and they know it. Notice how tea partyers are attacking the policies that have brought us to this spot.

Lol read today about how Bill was in SC during democratic primary in 08 saying how Obama had race on his side. But his wife having gender on her side? Nope

They have always been racist, sexist, homophobic, and probably a few other bad things.  The media just refers to them by their shorthand name; Tea Partiers.

The minimum wage never was, is not now, and never will be, intended to be the sole means of income for a family.  The minimum wage is intended to be an introductory, training, &amp; transitional income.

About 1% of the population and 5% of the *hourly workforce earn minimum wage.  Of that, about 19% are "family earners".  So about .002*, or .2%, of the population are trying to support a household on minimum wage.  In addition, very few people spend their entire careers earning minimum wage.


"Well if that's all it is, why not raise it?  Won't make much difference". 

Because raising it doesn't just bump the price of a Big Mac a few cents.  Why the big push to raise it then?  Many, union contracts base their prevailing wages on the minimum wage.  

Mid term elections are coming up and the Democrats need to get voters to turn out.  The ACA is a mess, so if they can make this an issue they probably hope to hang on to the Senate and maybe gain seats in the house.  

It's not about wages, it's about winning elections.

*Edit: because math
*Edit: [5% of HOURLY workers](http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2012.htm#2)
-----==----==---==-----
Please, numbers to back this up, please. You are saying 1/3 of the minimum wage workforce will be eliminated if it is increased? Please back this up with actual numbers. 
-----==----==---==-----
notice the influx of liberals upvoting bullshit comments? Yeah, me too
-----==----==---==-----
So what, we keep the minimum wage at $7.25 an hour forever?

What's the conservative answer?  25% of private sector jobs pay less than $10 an hour, and I doubt it'll get any better.
-----==----==---==-----
Either a living wage is factored into the cost of doing business or we ALL end up paying to keep the working poor fed and off of the streets. Right now, CEO's want taxpayers to pick up the tab. What do you think is the more conservative way to go?


-----==----==---==-----
This just happened in the Fairfax County Public School system in Northern Virginia. Teachers whined and moaned for higher pay. They even did a casual wear strike (jeans and tshirts until the board submitted to their demands)   
  
don't get me wrong, i think they should be paid better, but it should be performance based like most other jobs. 
  
The board finally agreed and said, we will work out your pay hikes as soon as we finish these layoffs. 
-----==----==---==-----
I think this is actually a rarer example of what the minimum wage does. And if you make this argument, liberals will refute it with the same graph they all use that shows "no correlation between unemployment and minimum wage." When in reality, we should be showing the increase in prices that people with low purchasing power now have to face when going to places like Walmart and McDonald's.

Also, it'd be interesting to me to study how operating hours change. If a store is just barely profitable between the hours of 10pm and 11pm, but the minimum wage makes that gap costly instead of profitable, will that store decide to close at 10pm now, thus decreasing the employees' effective wages? I think so.
-----==----==---==-----
You would think after all the minimum wage raises in the last 25 years America would have been dead long ago according to this logic. 
-----==----==---==-----
It's not that Democrats want the federal minimum wage adjusted a bit for inflation, they're asking for $10.10 instead of $7.25, an increase of over 39%. That's a major increase all at once. It's virtually unprecedented in the history of the minimum wage except for 1939 where it was increased from 30¢ to 40¢, and in 1950 when it was increased from 40¢ to 70¢ (roughly the same percentage). Note that unemployment is over twice as high today as it was in 1950.

I keep hearing 'buying power' thrown around a lot as if it were a fixed number. It's not, and we have a lot more things to buy than ever before. Today's minimum wage of $7.25 has more buying power than the minimum wage of $3.35 in 1986. However, the minimum wage in 1960 had quite a bit less buying power than the minimum wage in 2014. Those are just raw numbers that mostly have to do with inflation, and not $500 game systems, $60 games, expensive smart phones and gadgets, and college tuition that has gone through the roof. 'Buying power' is a variant, depending on what you wish to spend it on.

The bottom line is that with terrible unemployment, raising the minimum wage much more than a little is going to have devastating effects on our economy.

Unfortunately the 2 that don't get fired are the ones that are going to vote.  The liberals have been getting into office based off this logic for years, and will continue to.  You don't need to win all the votes, just most of them, and if that means upsetting a few by taking something and giving to the rest (even if it's a trivial amount), then you win.

because the mainstream media is too.

The illusion is that there are only Republicans and Democrats.

People have been trained to think that.

It makes people easier to control when you polarise them and have them waste energy fighting each other over pointless crap.

People in the US should just vote out whoever their local representative is.  Maybe some change will happen then, and we can get to talk about issues rather than the parties.


-----==----==---==-----
Reddit is significantly less liberal than it was even a year or two ago. We are moving closer to the mean.
-----==----==---==-----
A place where you can spend all day doing nothing productive at no cost is going to attract a lot of liberals.  

As an added bonus, mindlessly suppressing other points of view gives them a sense of accomplishment.  That's why they raid /r/conservative and downvote everything here.
-----==----==---==-----
Kids are dumb and self-entitled. The ones who grow up, become professionals, and start a family often become conservative

The founders are Reddit are very liberal and thus the site as a whole is designed to be accommodating to people who share their beliefs and worldview. If Conservatives had designed the site, maybe they would have changed the functionality of it to accommodate Conservative-minded people.

-----==----==---==-----
Here's the unbiased beginning of the article:

&gt;You’ve been warned: The fate of the planet hangs in the balance if Kerry Kennedy is convicted of drugged driving in a New York trial that gets under way Monday.

The planet hangs in the balance?  Talk about a family egomania.
-----==----==---==-----
....Robert Kennedy.... Jr.

Who gives a shit?
-----==----==---==-----
I think every Kennedy should have to blow in one of those things so the car starts!
-----==----==---==-----
He lives in a VERY SMALL world.
-----==----==---==-----
Ik they were american royalty..uhhhhh celebrity politicians but they were all horrible people I dont understand why people view someone like JFK or Rob Kennedy are like great American politicians.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt; If convicted of driving while ability impaired by drugs — **a misdemeanor** — she fears she’ll be barred from entering countries like Canada, New Zealand and Australia, and thus be unable to perform her important work. [*emphasis mine]*

I'm pretty sure no country on the planet is going to bar you from entering over a misdemeanor. It's like a speeding ticket. It's akin to driving with a suspended license. It's not a felony.

&gt; Kerry plans to testify in her own defense at trial, giving observers a glimpse into the mind of a globe-trotting do-gooder.

She's supposed to be a lawyer? What intelligent lawyer would act as their own counsel? I don't know any. That's some serious stupidity based on ego right there.

So she's looking at a year in jail, maximum. Kennedy or not - this is her first offense. No judge in America would give a first offender jail time over Ambien. She'll probably wind up with unsupervised probation and a fine, just like anybody else.

I am truly sorry about your Mom. 

The ObamaCare program is criminal. We are only seeing the very tip of the iceberg in the pure human misery this is having and is going to have. It is very unfortunate that people didn't take the time needed to understand what this is all about, but it was rammed through on Christmas Eve, illegally, with NO SUPPORT from the Republicans at all.

There is nothing amusing about this, nothing at all. I sincerely hope that the citizens of the United States recognize what this is all about, even after the delays designed to get the Democrats throught he next election cycle.

Always funny how the write laws, make them begin after another administration takes office, then blames the "Other Guys" for the failures.

Sarah Palin and the Tea Party told us for years about these people. Shouted down and made into Jokes.

Perhaps people will finally begin to see who really does have their best interets at heart.

2014 and 2016 elections are just around the corner. We absolutely need to stop this train wreck. It has already destroyed the worlds best medical system, and it will take decades to recover from this monstrosity of mistake.
