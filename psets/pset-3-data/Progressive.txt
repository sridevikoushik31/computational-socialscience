Alas, no amount of evidence will ever convince supply siders that maaaaybe their theory isn't as generally applicable as they thought.
-----==----==---==-----
Gotta see customers with money in hand and a need for my products before I try and sell somewhere. One of my businesses goes to trade shows and a big red flag for me is a state with no sales tax, which generally means no infrastructure to bring customers to the show and no infrastructure to support that show.  **I don't care how little it costs me to not make money.**  Another red flag though is states where sales tax is 10% or more, at that point it really does kill sales and it often means that the local government is trying to do everything through sales tax, which often means again infrastructure is crappy (Tennessee I'm looking at you.) What it boils down to is I have to see demand for MY product lines, whether I get taxed to get to that demand or not is less important. You can take a big enough slice that it kills my profits and that will keep me away, it's true, but that's a problem far less often than say, trying to sell to people whose wages haven't kept up with cost of living for 30 years.

Wait - municipal bonds?  As in the taxpayers are on the hook for the state pushing one particular brand of religious beliefs should these folk somehow not be able to repay the millions?  
I don't suppose they'll be fronting millions in taxpayer money for a FSM museum.  After all, it's not the official state-sponsored religion.
-----==----==---==-----
what a shame, that money could have helped a lot of people
-----==----==---==-----
Is this "museum" a tax free enterprise, like churches?

How? This is one company, with one commercial, where it pokes fun at Europe, and tries to play up "America". Why? Because patriotism sells. This isn't xenophobic, it's smart advertising.

You don't win. You just do a little better each time.
-----==----==---==-----
Don't be fooled. They're still around and will just change the name on their banner, as they have countless times before. 

And it's the same people: 30% who approved of Bush to his final days, 30% who identify as "Tea Party", 30% of the country who is standing in the way of progress at every turn. Keep looking for that number, because it's the same people over and over. 

They're not going anywhere. 
-----==----==---==-----
So... if the Tea Party is the enemy of the GOP and their figurative "cancer within," that prevents Republican unification... why do we hate them? Seems the Dems have better chances winning majorities as long as they exist to eat their own. 
-----==----==---==-----
The GOP is in disarray because of internal conflict between the status quo and the libertarian movement.  They have no chance in the next presidential election.  Our next president will be Hillary Clinton. 
-----==----==---==-----
Nah, the GOP just stopped funding them. I get crying emails every single day from Teapartynation.com begging for money. This happened after, presumably, the money (Kochs et al) pulled out of teabagging.

Either they got what they wanted out of them or the "Tea Party" brand got sullied. For instance, a lot of tea-party ground-level people were agitating for causes antithetical to the GOP's/right's goals. It might have just been getting too hard to keep the volunteers in line; they were going off in their own direction.
-----==----==---==-----
There's a problem, though: Teabagger rhetoric has now infected not only mainstream Republican discourse, but mainstream **American** discourse.  TP bullshit is sometimes visible even behind what more and more **Democrats** say and do.  Even if the "official" Tea Party movement dies, it's going to be a long, hard haul to pull American political discourse away from the abyss.

Consolidation, they're getting stronger.

Well, a lot of people regret that Hillary wasn't on the ticket. But selecting Obama over Romney? Very few. Very very few.

And more than likely not one of the outlets who reported the incorrect percentage will retract or inform their viewers or readers of the mistake. I would eat my hat if Fox and Friends retracted their statement about it.

A stronger criticism of Bitcoin than I was expecting, but I think it has one big flaw: It asks why white internet-libertarians are by and large the only ones who've bought into Bitcoin.

And I would respond, "Because that community is highly insular and so very little they produce *ever* leaves, regardless of its' merit or lack thereof. See: Rationalist movement."

There are much stronger criticisms of Bitcoin than "It's actually not doing anyone much good," which is what this article boils down to. I mean, it's fairly accurate, but a weak criticism.

You'd think, as Fox gets farther out in the misty flats of insanity, that a few of them would catch on but they just keep hanging on.  To keep them spooled up Fox has to keep ratcheting up the rhetoric.  It's really nuts.  
-----==----==---==-----
This article makes me want to curl up into a ball and cry. It describes my own father to a T. 

Over the years, we've spoken less and less and when we actually do speak, he ends up saying some insane bullshit that I can't ignore, like "Teddy Roosevelt was our worst president ever, because he was a progressive" or "Unions are to blame for how screwed up our health care system is." I'm an indie who leans left on many things, and right on a few things, and but mostly a moderate.  

I've tried to bring up and share things that we both used to enjoy, like history or the outdoors, but to no avail. He's been stuck in his own little bubble for 10+ years, with no sign of leaving. I don't even recognize him anymore. 

When I call home, my mother makes him get on the phone to talk with me (three-way calls) and he has maybe said a few dozen words to me in the past six months, despite being on the phone for hours and hours. It's like trying to have a conversation with the literal elephant in the room. 

Most of the time, I'll talk with my mom for 45 minutes to an hour, with him entirely silent. The only contribution he makes is telling me that he loves me at the end of the call. That's the hardest to take. I know he means that, but that's the only glimpse of the father I knew as a kid that I get anymore. 
-----==----==---==-----
I have a brother that is just as bad. Everything is Obama's fault. Everything is a plot. Global warming is bullshit. The bible is literally word for word true. Dinosaurs and man lived together. Fossils are a hoax. On and on.

Trust me, the Fox News addicts of my generation are not one and the same those who demonstrated in the 60's for an end to the Vietnam war, nor for civil rights, or equal rights, or choice, or farm labor organization. 
-----==----==---==-----
I'm 57 years old, white, and permanently progressive. I understand that a great number of the Fox Followers (screechers) are of my generation, but I don't understand why. I sincerely don't. People I'd thought of as rational &amp; productive have become paranoid and completely disconnected from reality. They fear facts, they refuse to hear logic. 
For years I attempted to counter them with truth. I spent too much time and energy offering facts to refute their insane, rambling fears and hyperbole. 
But it doesn't matter. They don't want the truth, they're content in their rabid echo-chambers.  It's quite alarming. 
Some of my siblings and my ex-husband are people like this. At times, it seems I'm the lone lunatic. It's a sad time for those of us who haven't fallen under this bizarre spell. Very sad. I hope I live long enough to see whatever this is die off, but I'm losing faith. 
-----==----==---==-----
Sounds familiar. 

My dad was a self-taught war historian who could talk at great lengths about the ideological conflicts behind pretty much every American war over the last two centuries, but now, thanks to FOX news, he can't remember that there's a difference between socialism and fascism (which are fundamentally opposing ideologies). He thought I was a "communist" because I believe in labor and progressive taxation, when those things make me a socialist. Of course those are exactly the same thing to FOX news, so they've lost all distinction for him. It really sucks.
-----==----==---==-----
What was the natural response of the Democratic party shifting to the right for the past thirty years?  The Republicans had to move even further to the right.

That is the nature of our 'two' party system.  They may agree on most policies but they have to *talk* like they are different- if only to raise money.

We have reached the point where right-of-center policy is 'evil, anti-American, liberalism'.  Instead of actually fighting for policy (starting on the left and compromising to the middle) the Democratic party starts from right-of-center.  The normal give-and-take, where both sides are seen to get something, is gone.
-----==----==---==-----
I really am thankful that my parents have stayed away from Fox News over the years. Of course their inability to reliably work the television remotes was probably instrumental in their own salvation.
-----==----==---==-----
Personally, I was very sympathetic to conservative economics for 25 years - until that recent financial crisis, and the near 2nd Great Depression that the government had to step in and prevent.  Now, anytime I hear a conservative babble about how "you know what to do with your money better than government," I think, what a pre-financial-crisis thing to say.  So many would-be homeowners, pension fund managers, and investment banks were mind-bogglingly stupid with their own money.  Any conservative with half a brain and a drop of genuine curiosity would consider rethinking things a bit.  
-----==----==---==-----
Fox really has harmed this nation, pumping misinformation and anger in larger and larger amounts. I know the statistic of the average Fox viewer being 68 is used in this article, but are there any predictions on viewership in the future? I know many I speak to in my generation are fed up with Fox, and what it represents in general. 
-----==----==---==-----
Happened to me - my mother was taken away by Pat Robertson's 700 Club before Fox was even a Thing. 

You should read some of Mencken's writing about the Scopes "Monkey Trial." Sadly, this is not a new thing - just a new flavor of the same old snake oil comprised of bile and ignorance.
-----==----==---==-----
"My dad is 67 years old, a full year younger than the average Fox viewer, who is 68, according to an analysis in New York magazine by columnist Frank Rich. I’ve read accounts of people my age — 40 or so — losing parents to cancer or Alzheimer’s, but just as big a tragedy are the crops of grandmothers and grandfathers debilitated by Fox News-induced hysteria."

Really?  I mean really?
-----==----==---==-----
I first noticed what I call "determined ignorance" of many people in the mid '80s. Tons of people listened to right wing radio and believed everything they heard, even if what they heard contradicted their own actual experiences. As jobs went overseas and wages stagnated, people fervently believed in trickle down economics, thought all workers except themselves should be drug tested, thought poor people had their money, and generally supported eliminating constitutional rights in the workplace. They fell for, and continue to fall for, every divide and conquer tactic the right wing trots out. They have taught their children and grandchildren to do the same. The good news is that when the economy nose-dived a few years ago, some of these folks finally started to realize the economy is stacked against them and that focusing on gay people or women seeking abortions or homeless mentally ill people isn't going to help them maintain a reasonable standard of living or save for retirement. 
-----==----==---==-----
I still can't figure out of my father believes this crap or just pretends to to annoy me.

I like how the loss of a loved one to Fox News is compared to the loss of someone to dementia. That's great !

As an old white person I resent this generalization. There is no progressive politician progressive enough for me!

Besides which it is not just Fox it is every damn news show on the air in all media. Progressives talk about 90% of the time ABOUT conservatives! Why give them the air time on the few shows who are around who claim to be progressive?
-----==----==---==-----
My Dad too. And my mother, and my sister...

&gt;I’ve read accounts of people my age — 40 or so — losing parents to cancer or Alzheimer’s, but just as big a tragedy are the crops of grandmothers and grandfathers debilitated by Fox News-induced hysteria.

I can't decide if it's sad or funny that he's comparing the death or debilitation of a parent due to cancer or fucking **Alzheimer's** to them watching Fox News.

I stopped eating beef in the US about 10 years ago because we don't test for mad cow disease. A few years ago the US was going to start selling beef to South Korea and the South Koreans actually rioted to keep untested beef out of the country. The USDA won't allow US cattle ranchers who want to test 100% of their cattle to label the meat as tested. The USDA says that if they test their cows but other ranchers don't, consumers won't buy the untested beef and sales will suffer.

-----==----==---==-----
Christians *need* persecution. Lack of it means that the "world" doesn't see what they do as a challenge to the "godless, secular" system. 

If a Christian spends all day handing out [Chick tracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_tract) to people and those people respond with a smile or gentle shake-of-the-head, it's discouraging. It's as if the ersatz Christian evangelist is simply being humored, given a pat on the head and then ignored. This will not do. A fierce rejection is desired, a denunciation, a barrage of hateful words, something memorable that allows the evangelist to say to himself, "I must be touching a nerve. They are persecuting me just as they did the saints of yore!"

Keep this in mind: **Many Christians think it's the End Times**. They read these verses from Luke 21 (in the King James Bible, naturally) and they see that when they are persecuted they are fulfilling scriptural prophecy.

&gt;Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.

&gt; But before all these, **they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you**, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake. And it shall turn to you for a testimony. Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer: For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death. And **ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake**. But there shall not an hair of your head perish. In your patience possess ye your souls.

TLDR: The Christians are expecting your hate and persecution. If you don't deliver it, they'll figure out a way to piss you off enough to react strongly.

[Here's](http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=IRS-2013-0038-00010) the proposed regulations. Not sure I agree on get out the vote drives. Definitely political, but also kind of social welfare.

Does anyone have any information about the number of the liberal vs conservative organizations targeted by the IRS BOLOs?

-----==----==---==-----
While public opinion didn't seem to be the difference by itself, when threatened with loss of money, the very forces behind state-sanctioned bigotry removed their own bill.  This had nothing to do with Brewer herself, timing dictated that a veto was necessary.  
  
The hatred/scapegoating/fearmongering behind this bill - which would have been signed into law if economic blowback wasn't understood at the 11th hour - remains and will just try again another day.

They don't need too. There is already precedence for the league taking away the Super Bowl from Arizona when the state voted down MLK day. The rumors are out there and the league is playing it perfectly, let the rumor go that the league may pull it..they already sent out a release saying they are monitoring the legislation. So, with that, they really don't need to threaten anything. 
-----==----==---==-----
They have also already make a public statement.  Something to the tune of "we're paying attention" etc etc etc.


-----==----==---==-----
The evident bigotry towards homosexuals, African Americans and Latin Americans should be enough to get everybody to pull out of Arizona.  Holding the Super Bowl there is shameful.

You know what I'm against? The monetary system. Not the fiat thing I hear the libertarians go on about, but the whole thing. Why? Because I once heard of a guy who stole some money. See? The whole system is corrupt. Get rid of money because everyone is a thief.

Oh my.  I tried watching that whole thing and I couldn't.  How do people watch this?  The stupidity is so difficult to stomach.  I was excited that it would be funny to watch how dumb they were being, but it's just awful.

 It reminds me of a bad food contest at summer camp.  Mix foods that taste bad and see who can eat it.  Sounds like fun, it's funny how bad fruit loops and Russian dressing taste together. But, after one bite you know you've made a terrible mistake.

The original headline for this article is overly broad, and the rewriting of the headline here makes this sound like it was a First Amendment/free speech issue. It was not, and the Supreme Court made that clear. The First Amendment issue has not yet been litigated, which may mean the activist will still prevail in his litigation.

This appeal was about the military's control of military bases. The protest area in question is actually on part of the base, although it's outside the gate.

Here's what I don't understand about the extreme right wing in this country:  What are you guys thinking?  

Sure, you've got your ideals and such, and I would be a liar if I didn't say I didn't have mine, but really guys, c'mon.  *This* right here is exactly what's going to get you placed on some kind of NSA watchlist, if it hasn't already.  As much as I don't like the police/security state, I also understand what they're looking for, and right now, these guys make the top of the list, outside of maybe Muslim Radicals.  The worst part is?  They can't even see it.  They don't seem to understand that.  They maintain this wilful ignorance and think that what they're doing is somehow whistfully patriotic, when in fact, it is opting for sedition and possibly flat-out treason. That doesn't sound very American to me.  But hey, what would I know?  I'm just a pinko-commie-leftist.  These are the same kinds of folks who think that their pissant AR-15's are going to stand any chance against the might of the largest, most well-organized and well-funded military in the history of humankind.

We've been hearing this 'Mooslim-Kenyan-Socialist-Foreignborn-Userper' rhetoric for years and years.  It's time someone finally looks at them and asks to prove it with real facts and empirical evidence that he is indeed what they say he is.  Otherwise, shut up, and stop trying to justify your butthurt, down-home, good 'ol fashioned racism.  Because realistically, I can't come up with a good, credible answer to all this hoo-ah other than just strait up racism.  They lost.  And they're going to continue to lose unless you start to understand that the world is going to continue to progress forward and whether or not they get on board, it's going to happen.  The days of old, power-establishment, white bigotry are numbered.

~~Pedantically~~ Technically speaking, any group of American Citizens is a ["militia group"](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/311). But setting that aside for a moment, the purpose of the militia is described in Article 1, Section 8, paragraphs 15 and 16 of the constitution, and the Second Amendment:

* [Congress shall have power] To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;

* [Congress shall have power] To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;

* A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state...

This organization seems to have a dispute, a case arising under the Constitution, as to who is actually the President of the United States. Article III Section 2 tells us who should be handling this:

* The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, 

So, we've got a group that disputes the validity of Obama's presidency, but instead of taking that dispute to the courts as required by the constitution, they are placing a bounty on him, payable to anyone who removes him from office, alive or dead. This group is not executing the laws of the union, suppressing insurrection, repelling invasion, serving the United States, or providing security for a free state. As such, it is completely improper to refer to them as a "militia group". 

The moment these people put down their pens and pick up a weapon, they become insurrectionists, and the actual militia can be called forth (In the manner that Congress has provided) to suppress them.

-----==----==---==-----
Why does anyone who makes less than $250,000/yr vote for these people?  I completely and utterly Do Not Get It.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't know what's more depressing, the fact that the GOP is pretty much just doing what a South Park-esque stereotype of the GOP would do, or that the majority of the country has been beaten into submission and isn't completely outraged over the obvious corruption. 
-----==----==---==-----
Can you smell the liberty?
-----==----==---==-----
1 million? Not likely. If 40 hours are required to make the insurance mandate kick in, suddenly you're going to see the 35 hour work week become the norm.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;increase the deficit by $74 billion

It amazes me that the GOP thinks running huge deficits is more fiscally conservative than collecting taxes.
-----==----==---==-----
This isn't really an "oops," it was sort of the point of the bill.  Change "full time" to 40 hours a week instead of 35 and less employers will have to offer insurance to their employees. That's *why* they did it.
-----==----==---==-----
Hello the incoming 38 hr work weeks for low wage occupations (especially retail and whatnot). I'm not sure how the GOP is ignoring the reality that many large companies will simply cut hours to avoid 'full time' status. I worked at Kroger for 4 years and maybe saw maybe 30-40 full forty hour work weeks. But I certainly worked many more 32 hour weeks (luckily our union ensured access to the healthcare plan).  

I wonder if this is a reaction to the 'people will choose to work less hours' report for last month. But I guess this is what we get when we elect millionaires to run our country.

The problem with Texas is that a big majority of the people who are suffering poverty-based hardships are Hispanic, and as a group they really have a "keep your head down" outlook on living here in America.  They vote at half the rate that white people do, so they are not fighting for their interests, the politicians who are fighting for their interests do not get elected, and obviously the politicians who get elected are not fighting for their interests.

50.5% of the people in Texas are minorities, but 70.4% of Texas voters in the 2012 election were white.  That's pretty much all you need to know about Texas to understand why "crazy gets elected" there.

In other news:

The GOP has a health care bill?
-----==----==---==-----
I would actually love for  health care to no longer be tied to employment. 
Your job should not be the determiner of your health care. Everyone should receive health care. 

I want commercials from companies advertising save 15% in 15 min on your health care premium. Market to me - not my employer who is getting increasingly annoying in trying to monitor what I eat, and increasingly intruding on my personal off-work time or face massive premium increases. 

Medicare for all is what I would love to see happen. I don't know what the GOP is planning, but you can be sure it's anti consumer. It always is with them. 
-----==----==---==-----
Thanks, Obama.
-----==----==---==-----
So at this rate we should have zero uninsured within 4 years.

The fact that we currently spend as much as the next top 14 nations spend COMBINED is so ridiculously excessive that it beggars the imagination.

You're talking to the wrong liberals, I guess. Possibly you aren't explaining your position properly. While I am not 'interventionist', I do believe we should have the most powerful military in the world. I just think we overspend for it. 
-----==----==---==-----
It's mostly because of our track record. "Getting involved in small fights to prevent them from ... getting out of hand." takes a lot of wisdom that is uncommon in our current political system. 

Plus, of course, our military and defense contractors are largely all about designing weapons as if the cold war isn't over. When your enemies don't have planes, you don't need billion dollar air-superiority fighters. 
-----==----==---==-----
There are two kinds of political people:  Those who get along with everybody and those who don't get along with anybody.  

The first, we elect to Congress. 
The second become activists and are never heard from again. 
-----==----==---==-----
I don't think there's anything wrong with your stances, a lot of them seem like they come from a logical place. I think other users do this just because any assembly of people for a common goal will have to suffer from petty infighting. We saw this with the framers after the constitution was signed: Adams and Jefferson were not really good friends. Like I hope the ACA is only a stepping stop to a universal health care system like Canada, the UK, various developed European countries, etc... but I find Rep. Feinstein's radical stance on the 2nd amendment and her defence of the NSA's surveillance program to be somewhat of a liability to the party and I hope she loses the primary but a democrat would win the election in her district so her seat would filled by someone closer to the center (similar to Harry Reid or Hillary Clinton).
-----==----==---==-----
Tribalism, mainly, with a hint of reactionalism. 'When you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you.' and the like. As conservatives have gotten more rabid and irrational, many liberals did so to compensate.

Personally I'm somewhat with you. I think we should have a smaller, leaner military that utilizes crushing technological superiority to solve problems before they occur with minimal risk.
-----==----==---==-----
Wait ... is this article using "white" and "conservative" interchangeably? Or have I seriously misunderstood something?

That makes what she carries a parasite, though some refer to them as "babies".
-----==----==---==-----
This is something an alien that forgot they were pretending to be a human would say.
-----==----==---==-----
And in the their eyes, the fetus is only a parasite after it's born and qualifies for foodstamps.
-----==----==---==-----
If she's a host that gives her MORE reason and right to expel the parasite.

Host...definition...*biology*.. an animal or plant on or in which a parasite or commensal organism lives.
-----==----==---==-----
He probably meant to say something  like "facilitator of gestation", but lacks the vocabulary.
-----==----==---==-----
But if a legitimate host shuts that whole thing down, then they're to be executed by the state.
-----==----==---==-----
Amazing that these guys get any votes at all.
-----==----==---==-----
to bad he probably doesn't understand the rest of how biology works nor the fact that he was once "hosted" by said creature.

well, she is not wrong about the mother being a host. Not so much on abortion

This discussion is always orthogonal to the real point, which is that neither way makes any sense.  Having many companies laying down that kind of infrastructure is insanely inefficient; having only one gives them a monopoly and guarantees terrible service.  

This is why we don't have competing water companies or electric companies.  We make them public utilities for this reason, and I don't see why this should be any different.
-----==----==---==-----
All of these mergers need to be blocked and these giant corporations need to be broken in to tiny local players to compete for your business.

For those who don't understand how bad all this consolidation of the last thirty decades is, just read [this](http://www.policymic.com/articles/71255/10-corporations-control-almost-everything-you-buy-this-chart-shows-how). Then you will see that almost everything we buy is pretty much sold by a very few large corporations who own fucking everything. We have no more antitrust, no more breaking up of monopolies. We are nothing more than consumer slaves to the largest private interests that have ever existed.

Bullshit! The repubs voted for this, got caught, and now the party of personal responsibility (which is somehow surprised that there's a backlash to an obviously discriminatory bill) wants the governor to bail their asses out.

Bullshit.

The author intended it to be like Ha-Joon Chang's 23 things they don't teach you about capitalism. I think that's a bit of a stretch. Just go out and read that book, it's much more profound. 

This list is still intriguing and thought provoking. But it doesn't aim at the heart of the problem, which is that global capitalism creates, perpetuates, and (some would say) requires a globally interconnected system of unequal exchange relationships between countries, ensuring that some will always be on the bottom and poor. There really is no such thing as "ending poverty" within global capitalism, regardless of what  World Bank economists (and apologists on the internet) say. 

That is the fundamental reality that this list is attempting to reveal. But too many of the points are attempts to put a band-aid over the festering wound to make us feel better about the system working for the global south. It's really not. For example, #13: "Poor countries can learn from the mistakes of the rich on the environment and life satisfaction" Yeah, but they can't really. Countries are highly interdependent, and poor countries have little opportunity structure to enact policies that run counter to the hegemonic global capitalist system. If even the bigger and wealthier "poor" countries cannot do it, we do a disservice in believing that poor countries just need to learn from the mistakes of rich countries.   This is just one instance of how the article perpetuates the victim-blaming of poor nations that it purports to be correcting. 

Still, overall it's a good list that highlights many of the worthless assumptions that people in rich nations have about poor nations. But I encourage the author to push this analysis even further. We need an awakening of consciousness about how the global capitalist system actually works, not the ideological claptrap that we are fed from core institutions that have a vest interest in keeping the system in place.

And if that poor SOB doesn't toe the line, they can threaten them with being sent back to their home country in shame. What a racket!

This article is silly and naive beyond belief.

Obama's Presidency is and has always been about :-

Protecting the banksters and bailing them out. No senior bankers are in jail for their numerous and massive frauds. None have even been prosecuted. The big banks are still getting bailed out at the rate of well over $500bn a year.

Protecting the arms companies. Military spending is now 50% higher than it was under Bush.

Protecting Big Pharma. Big Pharma made $85bn in profits in 2013. Mostly from price gouging American consumers and over prescribing - especiially anti-depressants.

Protecting Monsanto. Michael Taylor, ex Monsanto VP, was installed as head of food safety at the FDA. Obama signed the Monsanto protection act.

Pushing the Fascist/Corporatist TPP &amp; Tafta treaties that seek to boost the profits of crony Corporations and multinationals at the expense of thousands of American jobs, ordinary Americans prosperity and millions of deaths in the 3rd world through deny access to affordable medicines (to boost big pharma profits).

The continuing erosion of civil rights. The codifying of indefinite detention without trial and the effective repeal of Posse Comitatus in NDAA. The exponential expansion of the Mass Surveillance NSA Police State. Plus many other anti free society measures (war on whistleblowers, journalism etc).

Obama's Presidency has always been about furthering the power, the wealth, the rights and the profits of big business over the rights and future prosperity of over 99.99% of Americans.

An interesting take from the left on Greenwald, Taibbi &amp; their new media venture

Plus some insightful comments on Obama himself, e.g. on his supposed anti-war stance in his 2007/2008 campaigning (quite unlike the incredibly stupid and naive article from the Guardian above).

It also says a lot that the VA is such a mess. A failing of both the Democratic and Republican parties alike. Feel good rhetoric is rampant on both sides of the aisle and, again, nothing will really change until money is removed from politics.

I swear they intentionally have helped the VA fall into the disarray it has become because, otherwise, it would make socialized medicine look good and where's the private profit in that? If that sounds a bit too "tinfoil hat-y" then so be it. But, that's just the way I see it.

I swear I just saw them...") now says the 600 billion a year in the budget (the 600 billion we don't cut, not like the 600 billion from medicare that is "reckless spending") *is not enough* SO their solution? Cut pay and benefits for soldiers. You know, the same military that forced guys suffering from PTSD to return for yet another tour? I guess it's better to keep them all and pay them less and cut benefits than to have fewer of them. 
-----==----==---==-----
When should be replaced with "still" (title). 
-----==----==---==-----
To be fair, there aren't many up on Capitol Hill, or in the general population, democrat or republican or what-have-you, that fully appreciate the sacrifice made by our soldiers. As much as I feared the draft when I was a little kid, and it was in effect, I suspect that if a few sons and daughters of the rich men and women in the House and Senate were called for duty, they'd be a little more compassionate and maybe all this peace-keeping and nation-building would fall by the wayside.
-----==----==---==-----
They see a volunteer army as expendable and replaceable, especially in a bad economy. 

None of the people in our gov't really give a rat's ass about any of us, including serving soldiers. We are all just revenue streams for concentrating wealth at the top.
-----==----==---==-----
I think instead of more wars, they should upgrade the VA and take care of our troops. Massive stacks of paper files in 2014 is a disgrace.

Hi, I'm from Venezuela, I live in Caracas and while I'm writing this there are screams, gun shots, and "cacerolazos" going on, this last one meaning the people banging their pans to make noise as a sign of protest.

I agree with you regarding the US intervention and financing part of the unrest, BUT (a big, capital one), they're taking advantage of the people's increased unhappiness, threats on our well-beings, on our lives, with insecurity and violence rising non-stop, all of these subjects being completely ignored by the government, at least in their public speech.

This reality is not perceived through the corporate media, which is another notion where I completely agree with you, but perceived by myself on the streets. I don't have a car, I use public transportation and walk where I need to go. 

Where I'm going with this is, we agree, the US is trying to take over every country on the south with sources of energy and fuel, our oil, yes, BUT, the government, after 16 years installed, has not taken care of people's basic needs for security and we'll-being. THE MEDIA MANIPULATION GOES BOTH WAYS.

Our government has closed down radio stations and tv channels, masquerading the real reasons, so it wouldn't be obvious that they're being censored. They remain out of the air. The one remaining had to adapt to an "objective" take on things, meaning that any opinion is not taken well, unless of course it comes from the government funded media. 

The wonders you mention about our government and Hugo Chávez' legacy are not completely seen on the streets. Yes, some (very few) of the poorest people now have some subsidies, and yes, definitely there have been successful projects, missions and regulation of prices. But not one of these great projects have been working at even 50% of their functionality, and I'm sure I'm being generous.

I, with my own eyes, have watched many, many corrupt public functionaries making their fortunes, have watched robbery and murders on the streets, in plain sight, have watched gigantic lines of people waiting to buy toilet paper and some other basic goods that any decent life requires. If you need insulin for a diabetic relative, for example, I wish you good luck and recommend you to take you walking shoes. This applies with many, so many basic medication.

Please, if you truly believe all the great things about Venezuela, I invite you to visit our "barrios", the poorest neighborhoods in our country, where most of the country's population lives, and check for yourself how we live, and if you feel secure and protected around the place. I'll join you in the quest of sugar, oil, corn flour (the most used ingredient in almost every household), toilet paper, milk, among many others, which are supposed to be produced by the companies the government expropriated from their previous owners, to "increase their production". Well, I assure you, before any expropriation, we had our products, years ago. Where is the money supposedly used to make these companies produce? Not one of us know, but we all suppose where it went.

Again, MEDIA MANIPULATION GOES BOTH WAYS, including the sources you've been using for your acknowledged well-informed opinion.

This is my point of view, as a Venezuelan living in Caracas and listening despaired people in the streets as I write this. Some manipulated by the media, some paid by the US government, some with sons and parents recently murdered in the streets by common thieves (illicit fire weapons are found very easily, most Venezuelans have one), and some tired of having to spend a whole day, once or twice a week, waiting in line to buy a very limited quantity of the necessary goods needed in their house.

Give us something to fire us up.  Stop being Republican Lite.  
-----==----==---==-----
Just to toss out another opinion based on personal anecdotes, I vote consistently and have done so for the entirety of my adult life.  I have done the campaigning thing more than once when inspired by genuinely interesting candidates, and I do understand the argument regarding shared responsibility for Democratic party failures.  On the other hand, there's much to be said for the lack of inspirational candidates, particularly in midterms, particularly in places the party cares about (the infamous "battlegrounds").  It is one thing to drum up the base and rag on core Democratic voters for not turning out, but among "progressives" there seldom seems much to offer.

I'll definitely be out pushing Democratic candidates in the midterms, but speaking specifically on the subject of progressive candidates I've no idea what I'll be doing come the next round of nationals.  If cable newsies are to be believed and we end up with Hillary, I might be tossing my vote to the Green party or something like that.  I get the wasted vote argument, but I'd almost rather have another truly backward conservative if it meant expressing to the Democratic party that the corporate flavor of moderate is unpalatable.

I'd rather not use the nazi label unless there is actually a genocide occurring.  Even then, I'd rather not use a nazi comparison.  
-----==----==---==-----
Why are you younger people (yes, it is obvious) so hung up on labels?  Is it because your young brains are not yet fully developed?  Do you need the crutch that is labels to simplify the world so that you feel more in control?  

Also, it is quite obvious to most everyone other than you douche bags that the nazi form if fascism was far right, as it's roots were in reinvigorated nationalism and racial xenophobia.  I have never seen that exhibited in leftists.   However, there can also be fascist tendencies exhibited on the left as well, particularly in command structure systems; e.g, Marxist Leninism regimes.  Fascism transcends the left-right spectrum, but the nazis were clearly to the right.  

Finally, please do not compare people to nazis.  It undermines your cause and makes you look like an idiot.  It is also insulting to those affected.  I cannot even think of anyone I would compare to those people except, maybe, Stalin.

I have worked in hospitals for many years and always worked hard, and was almost always treated pretty well. I have worked in the sterile processing department cleaning, setting up and sterilizing instruments fore the last 15 or so years. Until the hospital I worked at decided it would be cheaper to just sell our department out to the lowest bidder. They came in kissing butts and talking up their company. Guess what right after we were all made their employees things changed fast. They did all this stuff and more, going around with timers and tell everyone to do it their ONE BEST WAY or be fired. we missed breaks and lunch trying to keep up as they fired everyone who couldn't. It's changing all over the country, this is the bullshit we are being left with. I say we all unionize again. It's the only way to be treated fairly.

Uh, I read the article, and it didn't actually sound sick, brutal, or ruthless.  That older workers can't make the cut means it's a job that's maybe as physically demanding as being a waiter, which many old people also can't do.  The best example the article had of demeaning behavior is that the employees get scanned for pilfered goods.  Meanwhile, retail stores, to say nothing of warehouses, lose the most inventory to their own employees.  This is standard issue stuff.  

The rest of the supposed travesties sounded pretty isolated, cherry-picked information.  The shittiest one is the warehouse that didn't have A/C, but news flash, that problem was fixed:  http://articles.mcall.com/2012-06-03/business/mc-amazon-warehouse-air-conditioning-20120602_1_warehouse-workers-air-conditioning-breinigsville-warehouse.

Also just one more point:  Wal-Mart is the largest employer in something like 17 states and is the only retailer in half the country.  Amazon isn't anything near the plague on workers that Wal-Mart is.  Wal-Mart has 1.4 million employees *just in the US* to Amazon's 97,000 worldwide.

Just sayin, i worked for amazon and saw almost nothing but good things. I wish i could have stayed there longer, their pay, and benefits where good, the management where not total dicks, they cared about safety, you got tons of vacation days. I never saw anything that would make me classify them as evil. A lot of this article seems like bullshit, and some sounds like they are trying to demonize them for things that aren't even bad. They are more international than Walmart? So what, they are an INTERNET SITE, it doesn't get much more international. they monitor their employees? Yeah, they track your numbers so they know how many carts you filled or how many skids you moved, or how efficient your picking station was. Why would they not do that? In my experience they would take people who underperformed and gave them extra help so they could be better, why is it bad to give someone more training so hey can be better at their job? Anyway, this writer is entitled to their opinion but this seems unfair and stupid.
-----==----==---==-----
I have divorced myself from Amazon.  Their level of evil grows everyday.

It's pretty standard fare for treatment of order pickers in any big warehouse, where people are employed as automatons only until robots are devised that sufficiently provide a cost effective alternative. 

Until then it's a job that an unskilled person with negative charisma can show up for hung-over and dishevelled, and so long as they stick to the clock they've got a paycheck coming in.

Its been a while but i think it worked out to a little over 3 weeks a year to start  it was about 1 week vacation, 1 week personal days, 1 weeks or a little more for sick days. The days also started accruing on day 1. The way they had it set up though you could use all of them as vacation but there where slight differences, cant really remember.  I havent worked there in six months so my memory is a little hazy.

Bachmann seems to be under the impression that the demographic forces that brought Obama into office (the black/women/hispanic voters choosing the black guy over the white guy) won't repeat themselves for a woman presidential candidate. Boy is that the wrong conclusion. 

The current numbers state that ([according to The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-2016-hillary-clinton-has-commanding-lead-over-democrats-gop-race-wide-open/2014/01/29/188bb3f4-8904-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html)), women voters are expected to provide a "gender vote swing" of 25 points. That is more than double than the 11 point advantage in the women's vote that Obama had over Romney. (The women's +11 Democratic vote in 2012 was sufficient to decide the election by itself... black and hispanic votes notwithstanding). If that 25-points hold true (and Hillary does run, of course) the 2016 election is over before it even starts. 

That 25 point advantage /should/ (all other voting ratios being equal to 2012) translate into about 7 additional points in the popular vote on the Dem side, which would be a 58.1% to 40.2% thrashing... which is pretty close the historic Reagan-Mondale blowout of 1984.

Hmm. Judging from merely the abstracts the article provides:

* The sex article seems panicky and at least 10 years behind erotic culture. Doesn't the author know that fewer and fewer people are paying for their porn, and so the 'commodification' that he's complaining about is already rapidly reversing? He should at least be complaining about sexting and amateur picture drawing/trading communities.
* The economics article is the standard neoliberal "But if we don't pay CEO's and stockholders zillions of dollars, the economy will be hurt!" argument. It doesn't seem to address, for instance, active detriments to  wealth inequality, and I suspect that the article's original arguments are already addressed somewhere and they're just behind the curve.
* The third article sounds like a philosophy-obfuscated claim that social conservatism is actually worth something, but no substantive arguments are mentioned.

In summary: Meh?
-----==----==---==-----
I agree with this article until the final point. This won't be an age of dysfunction. When a Democrat wins the white house again in 2016 it will be by a pretty wide margin if trends continue the way they are. Texas, Florida and North Carolina will be won by the Democrats. The electoral college will be so one sided that republicans with national ambitions will either have to resign their dreams or switch parties. This is where the collapse will come. Politically not demographically. There will be many people who identify Republican for a long time. But if you can't become president with an R next to your name then why keep it. So then the right will slough off the parts of its coalition that can no longer work and try to rebrand. Good bye Christian right, good bye open racists. They will be the same but much more open to gays, women and people of color and will actively fight along side the left to cement laws that will reflect that. I doubt they will buck science anymore as it doesn't fit with there goals of economic prosperity. And that actually sounds like a two party system that would work pretty well.

I don't understand why the child's benefit is such a big deal here. Do courts have to consider the child's wellbeing in divorce cases? As in, if the child's welfare trumps marital law, then shouldn't mothers and father's therefore not be allowed to divorce? I'm pretty sure you could show profoundly negative effects on children as a result of a traumatic divorce.

And even then, shouldn't the defense of the ban be required to show that the children of  an unmarried homosexual parent fare better than one that is currently married to a partner of the same sex? I mean, the parent will be homes equal whether the marriage is banned or not. I would think they would have to show that the piece of paper directly contributes to a lower quality of life for the child.

It's better that this hate is out in the open instead of covert. If they've tolerated this twit for so long, a lot of them surely knew how he thinks, since he's always running his mouth.

At this point, I would have felt I had no choice but to change parties, but they wouldn't have welcomed my kind anyway.

Anyone else see how a state mandated minimum wage benefits big business because it encourages state dependence among workers who would otherwise grow angry, self empower and unionize to bagain collectively and protect the value of their labor?

&gt; **Boehner made the comments about suicide in an April 1996 interview with The Weekly Standard.**

&gt; *Four months later, President Clinton over Boehner’s objections signed a minimum wage hike into law that lifted the wage by 90 cents, from $4.25 per hour to $5.15.*

&gt; *It wasn’t a clean wage hike because it included some Republican sweeteners such as tax breaks aimed at small businesses. The bill passed the Senate, 76-22 and cleared the House, 354-72. Boehner voted no.*

Fuck, does anyone read articles anymore?  Shit like this is what's paralyzing the progressive movement.

-----==----==---==-----
He's in congress, so anything he says he would do will for sure not get done. So sorry, no suicide. What we really need is people to stop voting for these asshats and then we may start to see a form of functional government, as it is, return. 

And BTW, that whole "that's just how government works" line is part of the problem. If we all know its bullshit and just let it go, how can we complain with an justification? Don't allow them to get away with it, and the only way to do that is to vote them out and scream for change. Or pull a Ukraine.

If he were talking about the present, I'd say he shouldn't vote for a clean minimum wage bill. If the CBO says it will cost 500,000 jobs, they should account for that somewhere with a project to create 500,000 jobs. Once the sticker shock of the wage increase sinks in, the job losses will stop. You just need something to fill in the gap.

What is the difference between poor Americans born in to poverty and Asian immigrants that speak little or no English and have kids that speak little or no English and they thrive here in America?

Just to be clear, I to think Boehner is a terrible majority leader and must go.  What i would like to see is more on the job training for high school and college students.

That's commendable, but what really would be a sign of bravery would be to put up a sign that demonstrates by "reverse psychiatry" how pernicious and discriminatory the law truly is:  Perhaps they could put up a sign that says, "This is a Christian establishment.  People who mock our faith by not having accepted Christ as Savior, such as Muslims and Jews, are unwelcome."  

Then people who haven't really given this law any thought would have a better idea of just what it really is allowing.

I am a factory worker. At my plant we have started to make 2 new products from other union run plants. those other plants have been reduced to only make around 20-30% of the product, while we get the business simply because it's cheaper to make.



I can understand why you wouldn't want your plant to go union and I kinda think that's why nothing is made here in the U.S. because it's cheaper to make it somewhere else

Or, you know, you could just pay movie stars and studio execs less instead of a 1 cent increase.

I always love how the argument gets framed as "If you increase the minimum wage price of goods will go up!" when it should really be "why hasn't minimum wage kept up with the price of goods going up? Where is that extra money going?"

Because all the extra money HAS gone somewhere and not where it should. Into the hands of few instead of the many which would have done so much better.

What exactly are the poor gaining then. If you raise their wage then take away food stamps they need to use their money to buy food.

1. Food waste is not the fault of GMOs, it's an industry wide problem, and linking it to GMOs specifically is dishonest.
2. The corn is regulated as a pesticide because it actively produces a chemical that stops pest damage. The EPA itself says that this has helped to **reduce use of pesticides by 1/3** since its introduction, handily ignored by subsequent points about how much pesticide use has increased.

The article does have some good points but suffers from a significant lack of reputable scientific basis and very poor analysis. It just goes to show that although HuffPost is usually a good news source, they're also very capable of shoddy journalism.

As a former Swedish Union worker I did a similar thing at my workplace.

It's not indoctrination but the books were very anti-catholic. 
-----==----==---==-----
Fox has a long history of cherry picking facts to fit their agenda. And this is no different. We're okay with pro-religious books, but we're all in arms about one book series which does the opposite? This is of course bs. If you have the freedom of expression, and the freedom of religion, what does it matter. The marketplace of ideas will choose the better one. But obviously Fox does not believe the Christian doctrine can stand on its own. And they are right. More people are moving away from it and finding other ways to fit their needs. The catholic church need no one to discourage people from the faith, it's been doing a fine job on its own. 
-----==----==---==-----
The problem here is the books do have an anti religious theme, BUT THAT SHOULD NOT MATTER.  A movie should be allowed to be as pro or anti religion as it wants.

I used to work at this plant, I guarantee that they did not get the UAW due to fear tactics. Everyone in the plant (White-collar aside) was torn in the decision making process. Rumors spread that they wouldn't get the new BSUV if they voted pro-union and vice-versa. We'll see how it pans out. Plus this whole fallout might be a farce, that plant is not making any money for VW. Chattanooga only makes the North American Passat (not  even some of the euro or chinese versions). Look how well the Passat's are selling and you can see how VW sees that plant. One of the greenest plants in the world though.

I would think this would have the same effect for them as the Chinese labor laws have on Apple (FoxConn), basically "*hurray, now silly things like having to treat our employes like people won't get in the way of profit*"!
-----==----==---==-----
The elitism is strong in this thread. Stop trying to force unions on people that don't want to be unionized. If they get "screwed" then they'll pay the price. If they change their minds in the future then they'll unionize. If a worker at the plant wants to join a union then he can move to a unionized job. You're not any more intelligent or rational than these workers, despite what you've managed to convince yourselves.

&gt;Major corporations such as Comcast and Time Warner must be nationalized and placed under the democratic control of the population. The only way to achieve this is through the building of a mass movement of the working class, armed with a socialist program for reorganizing society on the basis of social need, not private profit.

Uhhh....what a conclusion! "Just create a mass movement of the working class." Yup, I'll just hop out and do that right now.

Duh? I mean it's not like she made up some new concept it's done in England.. but bully for her! I hope it does take off and more people like the idea.  It'll help poor out and the post office both of which are in need of help.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm for getting rid of the payday lenders.  That "Big Sky" company is nothing more than loan-sharking.   I think you end up paying like over $40,000 if you borrow $5000

It's over 100% interest so they aren't kidding when they say "yes, it's expensive".   So how desperate do you have to be to use them?  Like someone threatening  your life?  Your kids has been abducted?  
-----==----==---==-----
Could also "save" the Post Office, which would benefit everyone. (ergo: Republicans will NEVER go for it...)
-----==----==---==-----
I'm against it.  Simply because when the government got involved in student loans, it then changed bankruptcy law to prevent people from discharging student loan debt.

It would only be a matter of time before a similar law was passed for short-term lending provided by the post office.
-----==----==---==-----
Liberal/former payday lending corporate office drone here--this won't work.

The volume of demand is something the post office wouldn't be able to handle, and they'd probably lose money. Most big payday companies have to scrap to maintain a 10-15% profit margin due to CODB and bad debt (that's less than most solvent banks). The real thing she should push for is not abolition of the industry but national regulation--state by state and city by city patchwork rules make it harder for them to try new ways to be less usurious because they don't know what's allowed and what's not.

Of course, it's strictly impossible for the later event to have caused the earlier one. But it is possible and quite likely that financial institutions engaged in risky, verging on suicidal, behavior because they were confident that the government would bail them out when the whole scheme collapsed. This is because they largely control the government. In retrospect, the result seems less like "moral hazard" than a very clever and elaborate scheme to shift massive amounts of asset value to themselves. So it is not so much that the stimulus of 2009 caused the crash of 2007-8. It's more accurate to say that foreknowledge of bailouts emboldened certain decision makers to run the economy off a cliff. Indeed, they made money on that catastrophe, and not by accident.

The article is saying something more nuanced than the headline suggests: that "While congressional districts with the absolute highest levels of enrollment are more likely to be represented by Democrats, many rural districts with very high participation in the program are represented by Republicans leading the charge in cutting billions from the program." This doesn't necessarily mean that "White Folks are the Biggest Moochers" or even that more white folks than black folks benefit from food stamps, though this latter is probably true. All it says is that Republicans represent more districts where "lots" of people participate in SNAP. The cutoff for what constitutes "a lot" of people participating in SNAP is not mentioned in the article.

I'm all for pointing out the fact that the GOP frequently votes against the interest of its constituents, and trying to mobilize people to vote for their interests, but the analysis of this article is simply awful.
-----==----==---==-----
With the exception of central USA (the dakotas , Colorado, Nebraska), i can't help but notice how many of the states that have heavy food stamp use are right to work states.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;"Statistics reveal that the city holding the most beneficiaries of the SNAP program (a favorite target of the GOP) is 99.22% white and 95% Republican. Owsley County, Kentucky earns the lowest median household income in the country, but they are the most prolific government-takers in U.S. existence."

"City."  

[Owsley County, Kentucky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owsley_County,_Kentucky), a county with **population of 4,755**.  The "city" being referred to is [Booneville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booneville,_Kentucky), **population 81**.

Frankly, good.

Red states have more economic inequality, on average, than blue states. (And no, it's not an urban/rural thing, some urban areas have stupid high economic inequality too)

We as a society should invest in addressing that. Coincidentally, it will also undermine the intensely predatory libertarian economies of redder states. If anything, the welfare levels we have aren't enough to properly address that, because they aren't enough to make people *not desperate anymore*.

Economic desperation is the primary tool of businesses in highly unequal areas. It allows them to get away with shit they'd never get away with in more equal areas, makes them more profitable, and as a result of their exploitative behaviors, makes them more competitive, ultimately disadvantaging more honest businesses elsewhere.
-----==----==---==-----
The actual analysis says nothing about the racial breakdown of food stamp recipients. It merely says that there are slightly more congressional districts represented by Republicans that have 20% or more of the people  on food stamps. 


-----==----==---==-----
I support food stamps because I think the country benefits when we feed hungry people (especially children).  It makes no difference to me who gets fed or what their politics are.
-----==----==---==-----
This blogspam post, excuse me, article has no evidence to support its claim other than a single cite of one poor Appalachian city.

If you actually look at the numbers, Minorities are far more likely to be reliant on all forms of government assistance.

http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2012/2012026/tables/table_32.asp

This table discusses TANF, and shows that African Americans are 3 times more likely to be using benefits than whites.

As for food stamps, Democrats are two times more likely to receive food stamps at some time in their lives than Republicans.

Who gets to assess the land value?  And an astounding amount of land is owned by non-taxed organizations (churches, municipalities, foundations, etc.) 
-----==----==---==-----
This will never happen.
-----==----==---==-----
This article claims that it would end the 1%'s free ride, but how much of the middle class has real estate as their main asset?

If you increase taxes on property, there will be a lot of people forced to sell or default.  In the 1970s, as land values jumped, the people of CA passed a law to limit the amount assessments could rise in a year, to prevent people from losing their homes due to taxes.  What's going to happen when people on fixed incomes who own their homes suddenly have a massive tax bill to pay?

I suppose this could work- but I can't see it being any less than a 40 year plan to implement.
-----==----==---==-----
A Few Thoughts:
1. We already effectively tax land via the property tax. It's an extremely unpopular tax that is under attack in most states, which means politically I don't see a massive expansion of a similar tax going anywhere. 
2. You could reform or change the property tax so that it encourages developers to penalize owners for hoarding land, rather than entirely switching to a land value tax.
3. Maybe the economics is above my head, but I don't really understand how you aren't creating an enormous economic distortion by adding trillions in yearly costs to owning land as compared with other investments.
-----==----==---==-----

Classic addict behavior. Any real or perceived threat to their stash or supply source will result in greater stress.

Hmm. I would suspect that rich people have always acted and sounded crazy (1), we're just now really paying attention to that.

I *know* that rich people have been propagandizing and justifying their bullshit for decades (2), consider the unionization, socialism, and general anti-capitalist sentiment of 1880-1930. That didn't go away without a lot of expenditure.

Maybe 3 is new.

4 is simply a sign the rule of law is deteriorating - that public police are being used less to protect people and more to persecute the poor, and the wealthy make up the difference with private forces. Frankly that's probably not new either.

5 is definitely not new. The "Roarin' twenties" were full of examples of the ridiculous bullshit rich people were indulging in, and those that continued in the great depression *really* pissed people off.

I am totally cool with drug manufacturers saying "We won't ship you drugs to kill people."

I'm OK with capital punishment in theory; but because it's always been one disaster or another in practice (**especially** in the US, with the horrible racial inequities, on top of the horrible number of wrongful convictions), my current political view is complete abolition.

But if states who use lethal injection (including the feds) change methods, I hope they pick something quick and humane:

* Firing squads have missed and let prisoners bleed to death; 

* Gas chambers are the very opposite of humane;

* Electrocution, ditto (eff you, Thomas Edison);

* Hanging as done by the Brits in the 20th century was pretty damn good in terms of quick, efficient, and humane; however, it seems like whenever Yanks do it, they screw it up.

Some Brit a little while ago did a documentary looking at methods of capital punishment, including proposed methods that have never been used before.  Here's [the BBC link,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/executions/) here's [a BBC news story that talks about it,](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7183957.stm) and here's [a link where you can watch the whole thing.](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/kill-human-being/) (50 minutes)   This is what he "tried for himself" (they didn't actually kill him, of course):

&gt; Having ruled out all four methods [injection, hanging, gas, electrocution], mainly because there was a risk of pain, [Former Conservative MP Michael] Portillo looked at an alternative, the deprivation of oxygen - hypoxia. It's commonly used in the killing of lab animals because it preserves their body tissue.

&gt; He discovered that [an atmosphere of 100%] nitrogen could do the job in about 15 seconds, and the prisoner would not feel pain - on the contrary he would feel euphoric, like being drunk. 

So, yeah, if you're gonna do it, use the old gas chambers, but instead of the cyanide thing that was so terrible, just hook up a nitrogen tank.

You mean the "do as I say, not as I do" law?
-----==----==---==-----
This is my take on it:

* They believe firmly in their fundamentalist moral code, which is some weird mashup of bits from the Law of Moses mingled with "the Prosperity Gospel" (it doesn't have a fuck of a lot to do with Christ and the things he actually said and did);

* The code is a bunch of "Thou shalt nots"; "Thou shalt not kill," "Thou shalt not steal," "Thou shalt not have sex outside of marriage," "Thou shalt not smoke weed," "Thou shalt not have an abortion," and so on.

* They feel a need (although they wouldn't express it like this) to impose that moral code on everyone else. Of course, IMHO, this is often a gross violation of "freedom of religion/freedom of belief", but they don't see it like that. (In fact, whenever they get any pushback on this, they claim that their freedom of religion is being infringed. Which is pretty horrible.)

* Closely linked to that is their unconscious opinion that laws/public policy should be based on what people SHOULD do, not what people ACTUALLY do.

* The result is that when an issue comes up, their first instinctive reaction is "Let's ban it!" They want to jump into the Criminal Code and "prohibit" whatever it is that crosses their moral code. (Or, if it's already "prohibited", they want more, like mandatory minimum sentences.)

* In many, many, many cases (hell, **almost all** cases), these kinds of "prohibitions", aren't. They don't work. Prostitution has been around for millennia, and it's survived Babylon, Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Greece, Rome, a few hundred popes, the Puritans, you name it. Weed and peyote were probably in use well before Christ came along, and probably even before Moses came along.  Egyptologists have found recipes for abortifacient potions that are millennia old. "Banning" something often doesn't "ban" it at all; hell, it often doesn't even reduce its prevalence!

For those, and many more reasons, these idiots have to be shot down in flames, preferably as soon as possible.

Conservatives have given Christians a bad name.
-----==----==---==-----
Don't you realize? *They* didn't write these crazy laws: God did. To make God happy they have to follow them, regardless of how irrational they may seem. Why? Because the puny human mind cannot understand the mind of God. It may seem irrational to us but that's only because we're like dogs watching a magic trick: It's beyond our ability to comprehend.

Trust and obey. [For there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlLYQyA47d0).
-----==----==---==-----
In general Christians base their ideas of moral right and wrong on their holy scriptures as do most followers of any religion,  in general people base their political views on their ideas of moral right and wrong. There's no crusade, its just people doing the same thing you and I do, vote based on belief. Words like crusade and sharia law are sensationalistic bullshit.

-----==----==---==-----
They also base their support of laws against killing people on religion. Therefore, we should get rid of those laws.

The vote margins in the last election, while very surprising to Karl Rove, were not vast differentials. It was not a landslide by any means.

When Bush defeated Gore, even here in the northeast where Gore won, the margins were within 2 points in most counties. 

The rights may be disgusted, but they are not going to leave their ideology for the left. 

And all the Lefts, while disgusted W/O'bama's continuations of Bush's unconstitutional policies, will not depart the left to move to the right. 

So the GOP may be dead, but its still walkin'. 
-----==----==---==-----
I think we should remember, that the last time a political party actually split, the every example the article cites, the country was in the middle of a civil war.  Half the states and 1/3rd of the population was in open revolt.  

It takes A LOT to move entrenched interests, and the modern political parties have had decades to entrench their interests.  The republicans are in a period of transition, and currently it seems to be hurting them at the national level, but they are doing very well at the state/local level.  They have a lot of real supporters, and we shouldn't underestimate them.

&gt;Comcast’s chief executive says not to worry: “It will not reduce competition in any relevant market because our companies do not overlap or compete with each other. In fact, we do not operate in any of the same ZIP codes.”

They lost the right to use that argument after they bought NBC and fought to end net neutrality.  Their role in content makes them a clear competitor in all zip codes across the country, regardless if they control the pipes or not.  Controlling the pipes just give them more power over that.

I'm glad Krugman is pointing this out, but unfortunately the government has not shown a care about the content providers also creating the content since the government stopped Paramount from getting into the movie theater business back in 1948.

Metadata collection is also ruled constitutional by a progressive federal judge William Pauley who was appointed by Clinton--while the only judge who said anything against it was a judge who was appointed by Bush himself (you know the president who first helped create the Patriot Act).

You can't outlaw metadata collection anyway, it would be like trying to outlaw anyone from reading the outside of your envelope for your address. If it is immoral for vetted, background-checked NSA agents to get a subpoena to read To-From call history of certain phone numbers they target--then it is absolutely immoral for Verizon to read your To-From call history and yet you agree to it all the time and they share it with all sorts of corporations and you would never know about it.  And don't you dare gimme that "but the NSA is government" argument, both Verizon and the NSA have to call the cops or FBI to even begin a legal investigation for you and both can do that if they suspect you of illegal activity. 

Metadata can never be used against you since SCOTUS ruled that confirmation of contacts cannot be used to solidify a conviction (See Smith v Maryland).

So recognize these pseudo-NSA-scandals for what they are, a political game. The only people screaming about it and creating lawsuits? Tea party leaders like Rand Paul. People who have a vested interest in successful anti-terrorism such as the leaders on both sides of the Intelligence committees in both houses? They support the NSA despite it being part of the executive branch.

Secret courts like FISC (foreign intelligence surveillance court)? That was invented by progressive lawmakers to stop Nixon from wiretapping domestic people with the excuse of "foreign intelligence." It's the judicial branch's oversight into the executive branch (NSA). You think SCOTUS or any legislative body is going to give the executive branch more power by removing the secret FISA court? You are dreaming.

So anyway, keep attacking the administration for the NSA, bashing the NSA in the anti-NSA-circlejerk on reddit, and spreading pseudo-NSA-scandals by libertarians Edward Snowden and libertarian Glenn Greenwald along with their congressional ally Rand Paul. You'll end up only helping the anarchists, libertarians, and Republicans instead of thinking critically. Go ahead, allow them to seduce you with nonsensical issues under the disguise of privacy rights--they've finally found a way to get young liberals (who didn't do the research) on their side and pit them against democrats.

It's part of a Republican (libertarian wing) smear campaign to vilify a government agency doing exactly what they were instructed to do by the law and by the executive--in order to get liberal-minded people to burn their vote on third parties and make it easier for republicans to win elections in the midterms. You think Republicans are not that politically savvy or smart? Think again you're underestimating the lengths they will go to.

Sadly, amending the Constitution wont matter in today's political climate where the state ignores it unless politically convenient.   What the state should do is undo the Frankenstein corporate privilege it created and empowers. End socialized corporatism begining with all business subsidies and future bailouts, then terminate limited liability protections and outlaw artificial personhood so that stockholders, the majority of which are transnational corporations and banks themselves, have real skin in the game and know true risk.  People prefer to overlook how any power a corporation has over consumers, workers, and the market,  is power provided by the state and enforced by the state.

&gt;Democrats let it happen. Democrats essentially did nothing while their pals in organized labor were clubbed to the ground; they leaped enthusiastically into action, however, when it was time to pass NAFTA and repeal Glass-Steagall

What a crock of shit. Clinton was the only Democrat that went along with the Republicans on Glass-Steagall being overturned. NAFTA wasn't a 100% Democrat supported item either.

What's strange is that even without this bill people are free to discriminate against gays. In many if not most states sexual orientation is not a protected class. There are also no federal laws protecting gays. So even without this law it would be legal to fire someone for being gay in Kansas. Some states/ cites have protections laws but it is not universal.

Really this law is simply spiking the football.

Colorado tried something like this with Amendment 2 in [Roemer v. Evans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romer_v._Evans). The state lost in the Supreme Court, which means there is official case law that prevents making second-class citizens out of the LGBT community.

I say this all the time, but lawmakers who propose blatantly, facially unconstitutional laws should be personally liable for the costs of the time spent and the legal expenses.

I don't know that its over. A federal judge in any of the remaining states where same-sex marriage is banned could rule in the opposite direction. That would then be appealed, eventually perhaps to the Supreme Court. That is what Scalia hinted when he intimated that they might be re-visiting this issue in the next year since it was "inevitable" that the majority decision would be applied to state bans.

It has yet to play out. When it comes before this conservative SC again, who knows which way it will swing.

I have since read that PBS is giving the money back but they should just keep it because they have proven I cannot trust them to be honest, honorable or believable now.
-----==----==---==-----
PBS isn't perfect, and absolutely, they should be called on the carpet for this, but instead of abandoning PBS, the correct answer is to contact yoru local affiliate and voice your displeasure. Also, become a member. PBS is way more responsive to it's members than privately-owned media outlets are. 

Of course we need to keep an eye on PBS, but we need to keep an eye on *everything*. Government, the media, and corporations, it's part of being a real citizen, and not just a consumer. 
-----==----==---==-----
The GOP is always looking to decrease finding for PBS, and this is precisely why - they want them to become more dependent on private funding, which would obviously come disproportionately from wealthy donors.

Even if the majority of PBS money comes from small contributors, they don't offer to fund an entire series, and a threat to defect is less significant.
-----==----==---==-----
This is the part where conservatives feign outrage at the apparent political use of public funds. Start ten investigations into what part Obama played in this directly. Leak something that connects this to Benghazi but is just made up. Then completely slashes the pbs public contribution. 

I am disappointed in this and I would like to see some reform inside pbs to abide by their mandate. Pbs has always felt like the one place you are not getting sold to constantly. My bliss has gone the way of my ignorance. 

Screw you pbs. You broke my childhood...

Okay...let's look at this from another angle.

Let's accept as the truth that we have completely mismanaged retirement funds for government employees.  Why? does not matter, this is the boat we find ourselves in.  

Let's assume that the Arnold Foundation is proposing a solution for this problem and that solution is the real deal, nothing underhanded, it is what they say it is.  Here is what this group claims ( from link in original article):

"Because of this shortfall, states, municipalities and school districts will soon be forced to take drastic measures to pay for their pension obligations. They will pass the burden on to the public either in the form of increased taxes or, more realistically, cuts to services that are critical to society, such as education. Without significant changes to the current systems, public pension payments will quickly begin to crowd out other discretionary spending."

If that's not true, then we have some manipulation going on.  But my guess is that it is true, that leaders have kicked the can down the road to the end of it.  Now the obligation is there without the funding.  So those two options are in play.

Now the OPs linked article claims that this Arnold guy funding the PBS program "is pushing lawmakers in states across the country “to stop promising a (retirement) benefit” to public employees."

So let's look at that quote in its original context:

"The way to create a sound, sustainable and fair retirement savings program is to stop promising a benefit and instead promise an accrual or savings rate."

See what the OPs linked post "Pandodaily" did there?

Now you may disagree with the remedy proposed, which is this:

"...the employer would instead commit to contributing a fixed percentage of salary for every year worked. This would eliminate cost uncertainty by making benefits a constant percentage of earnings and by linking benefit promises directly to employer contributions. Under this approach, employers can be as generous as they desire with employees without the danger of underfunding."

This is what debate is all about.  The fact that he was with Enron, is a Republican, or is a millionaire, does not play into the soundness of the remedy proposed.  It is either sound or it is not, that's what should be looked at.

I am a government employee and I will be pissed if they mess with what I was promised because of poor decision making.  But those coming in to the system are not in the same boat.  How do we give them a retirement that will not be screwed with because of ineptitude of those in charge of it?  That's the debate, not Arnold's funding of the discussion.

All news is propaganda.  I defy you to find me **one** news organization out there that just objectively reports.  It is ideological advertisement whenever any editor or reporter decides what to air and what not to air.  
-----==----==---==-----
Downton Abbey is reporting? Sesame Street? I'm sorry, I don't actually know anyone who watches the PBS news hour. And no matter the documentary involved, I highly doubt PBS or anyone else ever literally refers to it as "objective news." But just to be clear, *all* news media is an ideological advertisement funded by a billionaire to manipulate public policy. And that's not just today, that's how it's *always* been, since before we were born. 

The intelligent viewer, if there are many left, has always been responsible for making their own judgements. Don't take *any* newscaster's word for the interpretation of events, and sometimes the facts of an event itself. Listen, seek other sources, and make an informed judgement for yourself.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't see anything that matters. 

You can accept money from a organization and still produce objective reporting. PBS news hour was reporting the BP oils spill even when BP told them to stop because they were a advertiser. 


&gt;Now comes news that PBS is actively shaping program proposals in order to solicit a billionaire activist’s financing for his ideological campaign to slash public employee pensions. Not only that, PBS is airing the content financed by that billionaire without explicit disclosure – and worse, camouflaged in PBS’s ostensibly objective news programs.

OMG how horrible. I don't see one criticism of the content or the actual reporting. 

BREAKING NEWS :PBS needs money to produce content, foundations have money. More at 11.

the author seems to think that the same GOP that has had field day with slut-shaming, racist dog-whistles, and UN-invasion fear-mongering will somehow be loathe to embrace a new chance to cloak anti-gay bigotry in robes of righteousness.

Maybe on the coasts, but in the heartland, this stuff is red meat.  Just had my boss' boss complaining yesterday about Michelle Obama taking time off her "job" to congratulate that gay football player on Twitter.  Plenty of people are just fine hating on contraception AND gay people...

Religion tends to be a big enough mess without politicians getting involved. They always think their religion is the only one and try to give it special rights. This can backfire all over their bigoted asses.

I'm very ambivalent about this sort of content. Yes, stories of discrimination that people face need to be told, but I'd like to see some context, discussion, or just a bit more positivity than; 'Hey, look at what these jerks are doing!'. 

Also...

It's too easy to fake.

It panders to our worst expectations of each other. 

It fosters resentment and polarisation (exactly what the enemies of every progressive movement have used to divide and diffuse forces of positive change).

It makes me angry ... and nothing else. Anger can be a great motivator, but if all we do is indulge our anger, all we're doing is playing the same game as the terpers. 

I'm not a progressive because I want 'my side' to 'win', I'm progressive because I think we can create a world together where everyone wins.

Research from Philippe Jacquart, EMLYON Business School, Ecully, France, and J. Scott Armstrong, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. The paper's "official" title (the link title is from the headline given to the paper on Wharton's online journal) is "Are Top Executives Paid Enough? An Evidence-Based Review". Here's the abstract, which tells you most of what you need to know:

&gt; Our review of the evidence found that the notion that higher pay leads to the selection of better executives is undermined by the prevalence of poor recruiting methods. Moreover, **higher pay fails to promote better performance.** Instead, it undermines the intrinsic motivation of executives, inhibits their learning, leads them to ignore other stakeholders, and discourages them from considering the long-term effects of their decisions on stakeholders. Relating incentive payments to executives’ actions in an effective manner is not possible. Incentives also encourage unethical behaviour. **Organizations would benefit from** using validated methods to hire top executives, **reducing compensation, eliminating incentive plans,** and strengthening stockholder governance related to the hiring and compensation of executives.

What are the odds this study will be reported anywhere in the mainstream media?

I'm not so much worried about disproportionate voting as I am worried about this showing an institutional lack of faith in our system.  Why do we send people to "correctional facilities" and then never help them fix their supposed errors?  We just create criminals and second class citizens through our prisons.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't care that it disproportionately bars blacks. I just think everyone has a right to vote, including prisoners. 
-----==----==---==-----
or we could repeal draconian laws that makes them "felons" in the first place
-----==----==---==-----
I do believe, that this is lower on the GOP priority list than Immigration Reform. Restoration of Voting rights is a step in the right direction (forward) and there are states that could make this a reality. Unfortunately, states like mine (AZ), are not interested in progression. The private prison industry in AZ has to much influence over the GOP to allow voting reform or anything that may hinder their ability to make any money.
-----==----==---==-----
Oh yes. This needs to be done, and I hope/wish it can be done on the federal level. This is a basic voting rights issue.
-----==----==---==-----
Ok, a couple things.  One, if you argue that prison is rehabilitation (I know, it's not) but I that's the justification, then you should have the same rights when you exit as when you went in.  Also, I think holds finally got around to reading the New Jim Crow.
-----==----==---==-----
Once a felon, always a felon. The only ex-felons are ones who have been exonerated or win on appeal.

Maybe they should stop making bad choices before we let them make choices for others.

This shouldn't be much of a problem.  Most German auto workers are unionized.  The only thing holding this back might be the typical southern anti-union attitude.

'Company tightens the gap between actual value created and wages given for their workers, in light of rhetoric from Obama administration.'


Too pessimistic? Sorry. 

&gt;Calling it a "moment of introspection," the owners of the Dania Beach ice cream darling are raising the minimum wage of its employees to $10.10, the bump proposed by President Obama last month in his State of the Union address.

But I make $10 an hour. It's *not* a living wage if you live in a decent neighborhood. It's a survival wage, if you're on your own in a shitty neighborhood with no car and expenses. 
-----==----==---==-----
While $10.10/hour is far from livable in South Florida, I applaud Jaxson's for this important step in the right direction. Their ice cream is great too!
-----==----==---==-----
Republicans hate him!
-----==----==---==-----
To reiterate another poster on here, it's an election year and the GOP members of the House and Senate have some of the lowest polling numbers possible- they aren't coming to their senses, they're doing what they need to survive long enough to trick folks into voting for them.
-----==----==---==-----
Is it bad that my first thought was to check the source to see if it was from the Onion?
-----==----==---==-----
A real moment of sanity would have occurred if they had abolished the debt ceiling.  Its only current purpose is to give the GOP clown car a reason to drive around the media circus and endanger the full faith and credit of the United States.

Wow, that was quick and  quiet...but I've been sick in bed, so maybe I missed something.

If you commit a felony part of your punishment is that your right to vote is taken away. It is as much a part of the punishment as the time spent behind bars and it is not discrimination.

What's the complaint?  
That firearms are allowed in bars or that the sign bars need to use to prevent firearms have specific requirements?  
Someone will mass produce these signs and sell them openly.  
The bar will just order one and be in compliance by default.  
I'm not saying that I agree with firearms in bars (I am pro second amendment, but I still think a place whose sole reason for existence is alcohol isn't the place for firearms) but the signs should be formalized so that patrons will recognize them when they see them. (and that's just as much for the non-carrying person as the carrying person)
-----==----==---==-----
Funny because last time I checked there were still a significant number of college graduates that fall into the unemployed and underemployed category because the job market is still in the tank and they can't find anything better.

run on their platform, Govern, Be honest, have a plan that makes sense, etc etc
-----==----==---==-----
[Ratfucking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfucking) has been a staple of GOP politics for decades.
-----==----==---==-----
Of course!

They won't run palatable candidates that have a platform supported by a majority of the electorate. For starters.

But if you read the site, it's obvious:

&gt;A career politician and insider, Kirkpatrick was booted out of Congress by Arizonans in 2010 after she sided with Nancy Pelosi and supported ObamaCare. But in 2012, she managed to return after Pelosi’s allies came to her rescue with millions of dollars.

&gt;That probably explains why Kirkpatrick continues to be in in Pelosi’s back pocket.

&gt;Kirkpatrick is a huge embarrassment to Arizona. How?

They continue to lambast her. Then, above the donation form, in larger text:

&gt;Fed up with Ann Kirkpatrick? – Sign up Today

It's a little shady, maybe - clever, certainly… but it's not a "fake website" unless someone just doesn't look at it at all.

I dislike many Republican tactics, but this one... it's a little unsavoury and I hope Democrats aren't pulling this shit - but it's not quite as the Daily Kos is presenting it, either...
-----==----==---==-----
The concept of "middle class" is a detriment to all workers.  You think you're somehow better than that frycook or lifeguard or factory worker because they are "lower" than you?  You're still selling your labor, still being oppressed.

The line has always been drawn between owners and non-owners.  Who benefits from the non-owners drawing lines amongst themselves? *Only the owners*.
-----==----==---==-----
Philosopher Rick Roderick said that if you can take 8 years off from work and nothing catastrophic happens to you then you are not working class.  For everyone else, if we took that amount of time off work we might go hungry or homeless or be unable to afford health care. The point of this sentiment is solidarity. We should not divide ourselves by arbitrary income levels but instead by whether or not our healthy and happy existence is dependent on our labor. 
-----==----==---==-----
There are only three broad economic classes:

1) Poor: Can't make ends meet.

2) Workers: As the author specified, but can make ends meet.

3) Owners: Don't have to to work.

You can certainly be high low middle whatever of these classes. There's a hierarchy among street urchins. I've watched a billionaire kowtow to a multi-billionaire.

An interesting digression is that economic class is not perfectly coupled to social class. Some *nouveau riche* musicians, athletes and lottery winners could be said to be of a lower social class than poor, but thrifty and hardworking immigrants. One of the determining factors here is foresight. People of lower social class think minutes or days into the future. The worst is the junkie. You can be rich and still retain this mindset. The very wealthy and very foresighted are thinking about their great grandchildren's institutions. Similarly the hardworking, poor, but thrifty immigrant example might also be of this mindset.
-----==----==---==-----
I think this is simplistic.

Doesn't even the CEO of a corporation "go to work"? Doesn't he have Boards of Directors to answer to? Doesn't he have to work to be able to afford to pay the crew on his yacht?

So, by the criteria of this article, he is "working class"!

What about all the suited executives "working" for the company for million dollar salaries. Are they "Working class"? "Middle class"? "Upper Class"?

What about a retired plumber, living off social security and a paltry pension, but no longer working? Is he no longer "working class"?

This kind of thinking may be good for making slogans, but not for serious analysis.
-----==----==---==-----
This is so stupid.

The point of the middle class is that's the class of people who are most responsible for buying shit and keeping a solid economy.  Even Europe has a high percent in the middle class.

Calling everybody working class is silly.

I don't have a boss I go to every day I'm in outside sales. I make as much money as I sell, so if i sold 100% more than last year I'll see an increase in my pay. Now lets talk how much our government takes in taxes because of my wonderful increased productivity.  That's the bigger issue. The company sure as shit isn't taking almost half my salary Uncle Sam is. And what do I get? Right wing nut jobs and Democrats who would rather bomb other countries than fix ours.

So not every "working class" job fits you silly description.

Jesus Christ some of you people need to get out more.

This has really put young earth creationism into perspective for me. I'm still as dumbfounded and disgusted as before, but now at least I get a sense of why they're so staunch in such a preposterous idea.

I never thought I would see the day that I would be on the same side of an issue as Pat Robertson. I'm going back to bed.
-----==----==---==-----
Seriously. What part of "fundamentalism" does Pat Robertson not understand? You don't start waffling just because science is coming on strong; you double-down and stay with the belief that got you there. Fundamentalist beliefs *do not change, ever*. They are fixed, permanent, immovable and inalterable.

This argument is silly since even "old earth evolution's hypothesis" can easily fit within the bible's own narrative as long as you consider the origin story in Genesis as metaphorical rather than literal. A "day" of creation could easily mean an epoch of billions of years. There are some problems such as grass before sun, but you *can* jibe the 2.

What's the real fallout from something like this? 

I imagine a person who is easily persuaded to be fumbling between different beliefs especially when they're amplified by politics. 

Does this result in people getting more rooted in certain beliefs and not others or does it have the opposite effect, does this turn people away all together?

You know what? I don't believe anything has any power to "blow up" in the GOP's face anymore. Everyone said the government shut down "blew up" in the GOP's face, but now people are talking about they could retake the Senate next time. 

It's one thing for journalists to say "This made the GOP look bad" (something else entirely for a commentator on *AlterNet* to say it), but for there to be any actual blowback, conservative voters would have to be subject to reason, facts, and rational thinking. And from all the evidence I've seen of the past 10 years, the vast majority of them simply are not.

This degree of unintentional irony should require chelation:

&gt;"No single party should be allowed to replace fair-minded jurists with extremists from the radical fringe,” said a senior Republican aide.

&gt;“Democrats should respect the system of checks and balances that our founders established and resist the power hungry elements in their own base that care more about their own special interests than they do about fealty to the law," the aide added.

I'm not too familiar with this story. So what really happened? Did she beat the crap out of an officer? Because prima facie, it seems like they beat the crap out of her and called it self-defense.
-----==----==---==-----
This is completely insane, it's stuff like this that's creates a contentious relationship between citizens and police...Police forces in many cities and counties are pseudo military organizations wielded by government officials for their own ends, and not subject to laws covering the rest of society. If any other group of men had violated a young woman then beat her when she defended herself, they would tried and convicted, instead the government of New York City is prosecuting the victim while letting the predators walk free

When Duck Dynasty made an ill-tempered bigoted opinion about healthcare, blacks and whatever; his show rating declined by 50%.  

I say fair is fair.  Let's see if Fox News can, all by itself, put a dent in the new lego movie.  I'll bet it can't.  I'll bet that the more they talk about the movie, the more people will go see it, because Fox News has lost.  They've lost viewers; they've lost respect; and now they are losing even the attention of the audience they are going after.  That means that Conservatism, racism, Southern Christianity, big business, and the Republican Party have also lost.  So fire away, Fox.  Let's see what you got.  
-----==----==---==-----
Not to mention the gradual increase over the years of people who just don't shop there because it's a cheap, shitty store.

&gt; estimated to be upwards of 80,000

[*citation needed*]

Seriously, where the hell did they get that number? No source on who gave that estimate?

I watched the videos from the N&amp;O (who estimates thousands, not tens of thousands) and there is absolutely no way 80,000 people were in downtown Raleigh. It's disappointing the entire premise of this article is based on a figure pulled out of thin air. Why dilute such an important movement with lies?

My comment on the march from /r/politics.

**Art Pope is an even more pernicious scumbag than the Koch brothers. When it comes to scumbaggery it's really hard to top the Koch brothers, but this prick wins that contest hands down.**


**I hope common sense finds a way to return North Carolina in the not too distant future, though the GOP has enacted several laws and dictates that will sadly have a long lasting negative effect on any notions of democracy returning any time soon.**


**People need to start challenging the GOP and their anti-democratic policies at every opportunity, let the sunshine in and disinfect the government.
If this topic has any resonance then you'd do well to watch Bill Moyers recent show, State of Conflict: North Carolina.**


**Art Pope is a big fan Ayn Rand at her most pernicious makers versus takers bankrupt diatribes. That he would hold that cunt in high esteem is no surprise, as her "philosophy" seems to enthrall rich, pampered, scumbags like Pope and the Koch Brothers.
Like the Koch's Pope spends millions to assure that his anti-democratic policies remain long after he's gone. His well funded Civitas Institute engages in dirty tricks designed to make his detractors think twice before they engage in any activity Pope deems to be against his personal interests.**


**North Carolina is but one state that people like Pope and the Koch's have targeted for takeover. Unless and until the citizenry becomes informed and engaged states, especially in the South will fall like dominoes to policies designed to impoverish and destroy the remaining middle-class and continue the war on poor people. If you don't start to fight back you'll never even know that you were in a war and came out on the losing side.
All the money Pope and scumbags like the Koch brothers have isn't a match for an informed and organized citizenry ready to fight for a living wage, and a reestablishment of an informed middle-class ready and willing to fight for their very survival.**


**A war on the poor and working class America has been declared by Pope, the Koch's and numerous other one percenters. The fact is that they're presently winning without having to shed one drop of blood.
If we don't start fighting back now there will be nothing to fight for.
I'm not a believer, however, I'll take the new Pope in the Vatican (who knows first hand how pernicious and morally bankrupt these people really are) over the Pope of North Carolina any day.**

Fox News typifies why conservatives are such a fucking joke in America today: their tenuous grasp on reality has become full blown fantasy. They are completely devoid of any reason or rational thinking, and have abandoned all hope of reality, instead clinging to increasingly absurd fantasies.

With California being pushed towards universal healthcare and, seemingly, Tennessee being pushed towards free college education, it makes me happy but also angered that progressive ideas are only ever seriously considered when the shit hits the fan. Lately, it seems as though states cannot find it within themselves to be forward-thinking or brave in proposing these programs that exist, in some form or another, in other countries that are statistically much better off than how we are here in the States.

Maybe I am looking at this too harshly on the "glass-half-empty" side of things but that's my rant for the day.

How messed do you have to be to have Pat Robertson telling you to STFU?  Just by way of a reminder, here is one of Robertson's own quotes:

So, how many capitalism destroying lesbian witches do we have here?

Can we please remember to talk about where the missing 40% to 60% of all those pension funds went? They were 100% solvent according to the actuaries.

FYI, they were invested in AAA+ bonds based on real estate, the lowest paying but supposedly safest investments that could be made.

Of course that was before the bankers managed to sell and re-package enough toxic variable rate loans as AAA+ bonds and then force them into default, nearly crash the WORLD economy and collect on the sales of the bonds AND the insurance on their failure (that the government covered) leaving the bond holders at the loss.

-----==----==---==-----
Socialist here. Government jobs have nothing to do with workers controlling the means of production. Obama could create millions of new government jobs and he still wouldn't be a socialist. 
-----==----==---==-----
No one reputable is calling Obama a socialist. 
-----==----==---==-----
Does anybody remember what the word "Socialist" means anymore?
-----==----==---==-----
What is really funny, is that politically, Obama is to the right of Reagan, but the conservatives love Ronny, and hate Barry.  I wonder what it is about Obama they don't like.  He is a straight, Christian, upper class, middle right, family man.  What about him could the conservatives hate so much?

P.S.  I am not an Obama fan, but it is because of drones and spying, things conservatives were all for when Bush was president.
-----==----==---==-----
This points up the fallacy of Dems trying to play to the right for support.  I think they got in that habit since the Reagan years and it's time to end.  Republicans have no viable positions on anything.

Because he's not, he's a conservative. Is anyone really surprised?
-----==----==---==-----
No no, he IS a socialist and, as predicted, he is about to turn America into a socialist state. Of course, he has yet to do that in 6 years after winning 2 elections, and he hasn't actually done anything that a socialist would want nor is our nation in any way socialist but I'm totally confident he will unveil his master plan any day now!

FOX said so!!
-----==----==---==-----
Because that's what people think socialism is... Whatever the media says it is. Anything they deem negative. From pushing the keystoneXL to campaign finance coming for major banks and other corporations.... It all socialism to the undereducated blinded by false ideology. 
-----==----==---==-----
Government jobs isn't socialism though so yeah.
-----==----==---==-----
Oh, jobs would be expanding because he's a Socialist, but because he's a Kenyan Muslim, that means he hates government more than he wants to expand it. Or... I dunno. Just trying to come up with something. lol.

Do I need to mark this as silly/sarcasm? I hope not. :P
-----==----==---==-----
That headline is doubly fallacious: decreasing government workforce isn't proof of being a Socialist or not (the fact he does not support workers and consumers owning or controlling economic institutions they are affected by is proof he's not a Socialist); and the government workforce has been decreasing at all levels since 2009, not just at the Federal level, and President Obama obviously has little control over City, County, or State hiring &amp; firing practices.

I also heard the other day that a [recent report](http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2011) shows 53% of people in the US only make $30k.

Start using hard data on who gets paid minimum wages. Goto the BLS site for that.  What age groups, what jobs, single parents, etc.  

Next, the question is whether the static market model of a price control is appropriate when income is tied closely to demand in the aggregate.  Take a look at the survey papers on the effect on unemployment.  Obviously Kruger and Card is a good starting point for the affirmative, but there have been surveys posted on reddit that cover a lot of various empirical cases.  I would say that these tend to show no meaningful impact on employment. 
-----==----==---==-----
Your best option will be doing some research and formulating your own arguments based on what you find. There's tons of it out there - university studies showing how little negative impact it would have on prices and what positive impact it would have on buying power, historical arguments about the impact of inflation over time to the value of the minimum wage, hell, you could talk about how Henry Ford paid his workers so well. Nothing conservatives love more than a good capitalist. But please go find some real, solid, reputable work and use that instead of just asking people to do it for you. For one thing, if you do the work yourself you'll be able to back up your arguments instead of just repeating what someone here says. Also, it doesn't matter how good your argument is if you can't speak well, so please spend some time going over exactly what you're going to say and how you're going to say it to polish your presentation. 
Good luck!

Okay, a lot of good things mentioned before me, I'd like to summarize:

* **Productivity:** Raising the minimum wage will allow for workers to contribute more at work, worrying less about basic needs and focusing on their task. There will be less need to form labor unions, and the workers on strike for minimum wages now are a great example of that. ^[[1]](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage1-2012-03.pdf)

* **Adjustments to Inflation:**  Gradual increases in the minimum wage stabilize the economy if more and more money is being printed each day, by keeping the gap between the rich and the poor manageable, and supporting the middle class. ^[[2]](http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com/facts/entry/amount-with-inflation/)

* **Consumption:** Making sure that even the most poorly-paid workers have enough money to spend some stimulates the economy by introducing an entirely new demographic of consumers for businesses. ^[[3]](http://www.njpp.org/blog/raising-the-minimum-wage-makes-good-economic-sense)

* **Morality:** Even if, for some reason a laborer being paid $2.00/hour is productive, it is just immoral for anyone to not be treated like a human being. These people may have no place to sleep and could have no place to sleep, be vulnerable to disease, and wonder why this great country allows for this to happen. Let's not forget that the human rights violations of the Industrial Revolution led to the creation of the minimum wage, and inflation has led to its changes. ^[[4]](http://letjusticeroll.org/news/001148-why-were-minimum-wage-laws-established)


The conservatives might respond by saying that it will increase unemployment, but remind them that due to increased consumption businesses could earn more money and hire those people temporarily laid off. 

Good luck man. Thanks for asking.

I hope they raise it to 25 an hour. That way I can afford to stay home part time. I dont think this is unreasonable cause it is fair. I want a family and a house. I am not asking to much, I just need enuf to get by.

No one can work 271 times harder than the median wage earner. It's simply not possible. 

History shows that if the wealthy continue to accrue assets without any regard to the underclasses, they're going to get their heads chopped off. Literally.

You'd think they'd want to avoid that sort of situation. Apparently not.
-----==----==---==-----
The capitalist started the war by being greedy selfish tyrants. If everyone was paid a fair amount money for the services they provide in society the money would multiply and the economy would be in a better state.  Instead these greed mongers keep all of the money stagnating the economy.  Perkins is comparing a racist war to an economic situation.  It just goes to show how juvenile and selfish the thought process is among the capitalists.  I am sure these doods work hard but not billions of dollars harder.  They lucked out.  Thanks for posting.
-----==----==---==-----
They need to think like their wealth is a result of them being better to keep compartmentalizing the obviously unfair system which props them up.

Government regulations ARE the problem, I am sure that if we reform the tax codes and RETURN to a 90% TOP MARGINAL TAX RATE that all the rest of the problems will solve themselves because clowns like this guy will fall all over himself doing societally useful things with money instead of paying taxes on it. 
-----==----==---==-----
When people tell you that they get ahead from hard work, you need to ask them from who's hard work.

"Zell ...sees **envy of the rich** and class warfare as growing problems in America, **blaming government regulations** for a widening income gap."

Envy of the rich. Yep, that's the problem with the middle class. They are just starry-eyed dreamers who swoon when they think of the lives of the rich and famous.

Government regulations. We can't have a government of, for and by the people clamping down on what corporations can do. And Zell can undoubtedly point to at least one other country who's taken his wisdom to heart, thrown off the shackles of onerous governmental regulations and is reaping the benefits.
-----==----==---==-----
It is especially sickening to see a 1%-er comparing himself to a victim of the Holocaust.  What kind of gold-plated bubble is this asshole living in?

Where is the State (federal or otherwise) to protect fairness and justice?

Or is whether two people of the same gender getting married more important?

I do hope Obama raises the minimu wage to $15 (it will actually improve the economy overall)

You know, sometimes I forget that people are this openly awful to others. And proud of that fact. Some people are just nasty, terrible people.

It's interesting how Congressional Republicans are on board with Obama in regard to free trade, and how Obama's own party is balking particularly on fast track. Apparently, Obama is trustworthy enough for free markets, just not free people.
-----==----==---==-----
Yes. And they will.
-----==----==---==-----
Well, Obama has seemingly been very diplomatic with Congress in that he has not issued many Executive Orders when he could have. This has definitely resulted in a near black and white picture of who is holding up certain issues, but it also means those issues have been held up and our progress has been incredibly slow. The administration, to me, seems impotent due to this strategy.
     
Are Executive Orders the best and should they go unchallenged? Of course not, every political policy and action decision (especially unilateral ones) should be challenged by political peers, analysts and Civil Rights advocates. The point is to create movement. Our political system has seemed so stagnant during Obama's terms, though this could very well be progress relative to Congress mostly going along with Bush (not completely or always, just a general statement).
     
As far as the article specifically, the clip from Boehner certainly seems like he's inching away from Immigration. I think that's a good sign, it's a hint they might be recognizing that they can't just stonewall issues anymore (hopefully). The last part:
&gt;The president’s going to have to demonstrate to the American people and to my colleagues that he can be trusted to enforce the law as it is written.
     
Is also encouraging, it's far more positive than GOP leaders simply saying "He can't be trusted, it's not going to work". Again, this is movement we should have seen years ago.
     
Now, back to the NSA and Five Eyes coalition.
-----==----==---==-----
Immigration reform is doomed because nobody is willing to stop the flow of illegal border crossings. Most conservatives could accept some legal status as long as it is not citizenship. Nobody seems willing to seriously block people from coming in and treating them as criminals when they do.

On the one hand, Obama's deported WAY more people than Shrub ever did.

Huffington Post has successfully driven down wages of freelance writers by flooding the market with free content. When it was sold to AOL for $300 million the army of free contributors got nothing. Arianna charged RETAIL at her book party and accepted CREDIT CARDS for her book Third World America. 

Now they're featuring stories from freelance writers who used to have financial stability?! GAH!!!

Hello, elephant in the room - the Huffington Post is not pro-labor and pro-good jobs - it's pro-link bait and pro-Arianna Huffington.

There's a lot of bs floating around Reddit on the so-called anti-gay laws in Russia. Gays are the perfect political pawns, because they are the perfect tool for attempts at discrediting people who are considered conservatives by people who style themselves liberals. You watch over time how the pawn changes. Before homosexuals, the pawn was the poor oppressed Muslim woman, who was been held in bondage by those evil Muslim barbaric male savages from the deserts of Arabia. To free her we vilified her religion and banned her from dressing as she pleases and we bombed her. Because freedom. That's just how we liberals and progressives roll, yo. We are tolerant of everything that fits exactly with our values. And if you don't support that then you're with the terrorists
I have zero dark thirty illusions about this post gaining any type of traction in this subreddit. It doesn't fit with the general consensus-engineered narrative. The so-called liberal view is just as narrow minded as the so-called conservative view. Two turds in the same toilet bowl accusing each other of being stinky

I agree with Biden but it's too bad his party and his boss [think differently](http://www.salon.com/2012/02/15/obama_to_unions_see_you_next_year/)

You know? I am tired of flowery words by Democrats. I want to see some real, progressive, action. Plus, I have some real complicated feelings about unions. 

I think unions ought to exist but I have a real problem with union presidents earning much more than the workers they represent. I have said this before on here but I believe union presidents' salary should be the average of the people they represent and be considered a "first among equals".

I don't know. Nice words, again, spoken by a Democrat but show me universal pensions for private and public workers, because the 401k is a sham. Show me an Administration that doesn't make it harder to form unions (see link above) and show me union presidents who are not paid much, much more than the worker's they represent and then I'll start believing in the Democratic party again.
-----==----==---==-----
Truer words have not been spoken. There are a ton of bad things about labour unions and organized labour (rent seeking behaviour), but without them, there are no powerful challengers to corporate malfeasance.

Uh, I get his point, but I think that's kind of a terrible analogy here. The book *Waiting for the Barbarians* is about a town that's preparing for an attack from outside bogeymen that really don't exist...
-----==----==---==-----
Isn't it "keeping the barbarians *from* the gate"? This implies the unions are actively inviting barbarians to camp out at the gate in some "Occupy the Gate" movement.

police unions?

One of my students works at a large state university.  He's the manager of a very successful department, and, despite the union, has made a hugely positive impact on the university as well as the local economy.  He has five union members working for his department and he says they are all worthless: come to work when they want, leave early, don't comply with guidelines, don't do the work that the non-union members do.

Blows my mind that these companies can't even fathom or care to consider that there's always accidents and spills. Eventually something will always go wrong. But when the focus is on short term profits, it's cheaper to just pay a fine than build proper backup containment and safety measures. If left to their own devices, there's not much chance of industry being so proactive in their waste storage/disposal or stewardship of the land. Actually, they seem to all be lobbying for further deregulation. Basically just like financial regulations - ineffective at best, more likely simply perpetuating the current system.

I think he means Marxist in the academic sense, not the fox news pejorative sense.  Despite the opinions on faux news, Marxism is a widespread, legitimate, and relevant academic subject.  Having studied Marx and Marxism in school, its my opinion that the article is rather spot on regarding the style the onion presents itself.  In juxtaposition to mainstream news sources which are unapologeticly classically liberal, that is to say conservative, the onion does offer an analysis that at least uses the language of dialectical materialism.  In conclusion I don't believe that author is right wing at all, in fact I think he and his article are a definitely left wing argument that encourage us to be more critical of what we think of as "news".

However I did suggest two groups of people who might be willing to work for $2 per hour. The first group — which was edited out — was the unpaid interns who tend to value work experience and connections more than pay. (In fact, “The Daily Show” staffer who booked me, and who was present during the interview, had been thrilled to start there as an unpaid intern).


The problem is that the only people who can intern for free are those who can have their lives bankrolled by their parents. Does that sound fair or like a satisfactory solution to the low wage problem? I don't understand how you can become a billionaire by being so fucking stupid.

know how i know i'll never get a long with a person?  It takes three questions.

* What do you feel about the Zimmerman case?
* Do you think Paula Dean was treated unfairly for her controversial comments?
* Do you think Duck Dynasty was treated unfairly for his controversial comments?

If they act like two rich people who were prevented from getting richer for being bigots is a "travesty" but an unarmed teenage black boy deserved to die, i know all i need to know about that person.

And without fail - people answer all three of these questions completely in my favor or completely against what i feel.  As a rule.  Haven't found me a single exception yet.

And that's how you know - when conservative fuck bags and privileged little shits, when they say things about how "it's not about race" or they distract you and say it's about something else other than cultural sensitivities and justice - that they're just doing mental gymnastics to hide their hatefulness.  It's finding PC ways to rationalize and voice their bigoted bullshit.

They thrive on your outrage. If you ignore people like Zimmerman, they eventually go away. 
-----==----==---==-----
It's just sad that people have given so much attention to Zimmerman after the trial that now he's a supposed "celebrity", whatever the hell celebrity means nowadays.
-----==----==---==-----
He's a murderer, plain and simple. He should be in prison, not getting all this unwarranted attention.
-----==----==---==-----
"Trayvon’s death is a painful reminder of the way white supremacy lords over black life in the United States" ...really? Is the author of the article a member of the black panthers or something?

After reading through the comments on the article from the page as well as those here, I think one is appropriate here: "George Zimmerman articles have the same effect on racists freshly fallen rain has on earth worms. It brings them out in droves."
-----==----==---==-----
Danny Bonabuce status unlocked.
-----==----==---==-----
That sentiment can not be repeated enough.  Fuck george zimmerman.
-----==----==---==-----
I didn't allow shit, but you are certainly aiding them in keeping the news fresh in everyone's mind. 
-----==----==---==-----
The outrage over this is racially motivated and deeply emotional. Without the race of Trayvon or Zimmerman as a factor the trial would have been straightforward &amp; uncontroversial (if it even went to court.) The trial was a flashpoint for preexisting frustrations over discrimination and this should not hinder what should be equal application of law.
-----==----==---==-----
Am I missing something with the Zimmerman case? A guy is attacked by a stranger and defends himself with a licensed firearm... isn't that basic self defense? The police report claims Martin was on top of him saying "I'm going to kill you" while beating him and Zimmerman fired a single shot from his back. An unfortunate situation to be sure, but hardly the racially motivated hate crime it's portrayed to be. The guys hispanic and by all accounts not racist. Am I dealing with the wrong information here? Did Zimmerman initiate the attack or was he investigating suspicious activity, while on neighborhood watch, in a place that had recent break ins?
-----==----==---==-----
There are important issues, but this article is fucking garbage.

It's an over exaggerated self righteous passion piece about someones opinion. It's promoting racial divide and placing blame based on purely by racial and social groups.

Issues such as this don't arise due to an entire culture or group of people. Articles like this do more harm than good.
-----==----==---==-----
The whole thing is sick. If I was Trayvon's dad I would have pulled some Law Abiding Citizen shit by now. The man is a saint for not killing Zimmerman by now.
-----==----==---==-----
I think we can all agree that the media did a great job in sending an important message to black teenagers : middle aged white(ish) guys are the most likely group to use violence against you. 

Sarcasm. 
-----==----==---==-----
I can't muster any outrage.  His life is finished, he'll be dead or in prison within three years.
-----==----==---==-----
Thanks OP. This sparked a massive flame war. Also, it is increasingly obvious that right wing douchebags stalk our sub ready to leap in and defend Zimmerman should his name arise. It's very telling.
-----==----==---==-----
Does nobody realize that zimmerman called the police and told them he was following trayvon and the cop told him to stop following him? But he proceeded to follow trayvon while trayvon was trying to lose zimmerman, zimmerman was cutting through backyards and shit just to get back to trayvon. Yeah what a threat he was to him. 
Paula deen is a racist, she had her black employees play the roles of slaves without letting them know ( for her catering company ) and the fucking duck dynasty guy is a racist too or maybe hes just trolling for attention who gives a shit nobody should waste their time watching duck dynasty or following paula deen theyre both usleless human beings including zimmerman who has the cops called on him for domestic abuse almost once a month. 
-----==----==---==-----
I thought George was Hispanic? Doesn't kind of negate the whole white supremacist angle behind this? Also Trayvon was martyred by people who share the same view as the writer.

Martin gave Zimmerman a beat down, an utter expression of righteous justice from the heart of whuppin'-loving Black culture. This culture of whuppin's sets the stage for much later violence, violent blacklash and the 52 (!) dead in the LA riots. The problem is the violence of Black culture, partly attributable to the violence of overall culture, historically white culture (as being at one time dominant), slavery, and African culture. 
-----==----==---==-----
You're the one making the spectacle now so fuck you, man.
-----==----==---==-----
Zimmerman is Travis Bickle. It's like everyone on the right watched *Taxi Driver* and got the moral of the story exactly wrong.
-----==----==---==-----
This kind of shit is why racism still exists. Both sides of the coin are keeping racism alive. The pro "black" side and the pro "white" side. Even the people who think that they're helping black people by speaking out against every incident where a white guy does something stupid to a black person, you're making it worse.

These big "black vs. white" situations are the sigle biggest reason racism is still a real problem.

Did Zimmerman kill a kid under shady circumstances? Yes. Should he have been convicted? In my opinion, he should have been punished in some way for instigating it at the very least. Does it matter that the kid is black? Not to me, it matters that the kid is dead. Regardless of his skin colour.

You see, this is where I take issue:

&gt;18-year-old Carlos Mustelier was shot to death, after he and his 16-year-old friend approached Thomas Baker jogging, and one took a swing at him. Thomas responded “You wanna play games? You wanna play games?” and fired eight shots. The surviving teen said they planned to rob Baker, but neither was armed. A Hillsborough County prosecutor opted not to charge Baker.

Stand Your Ground was written specifically to permit exactly this kind of self-defense in places where the Castle Doctrine doesn't apply. No amount of pseudo-progressive hand-wringing  will convince me to shed tears for a dead mugger who was plenty old enough to know the risks involved in assault and robbery, or to want to force a ridiculous "duty to retreat" upon those who have acted in defense of their lives as it was before Stand Your Ground was implemented. 

By all means, ThinkProgress, keep up the obviously transparent scaremongering. As you said yourself, "Out of 134 fatal Florida cases analyzed by the Tampa Bay Times in which the Stand Your Ground defense was raised or played a role, 19 percent saw the deaths of children or teens." This is, of course, to be compared to the 29% of the overall population that age group makes up. If anything, this article leads me to believe that children and teens are underrepresented in SyG-related cases. 

In other non-news, cases of fatal medical malpractice and police misconduct continue to outnumber shooting deaths (justified or otherwise) in the US. I'll not be convinced that civilian gun ownership is unreasonably dangerous until cops and doctors can manage to kill fewer kids than shooters. 
-----==----==---==-----
This article repeatedly talks about cases where people tried to use stand your ground as a defense even though it was not a viable defense for them.  Just because someone uses the defense does not mean it is an actual stand your ground case. I can go to the super market and shoot the casheir, then claim stand your ground, it doesent mean it means the law is incorrect, it means im an idiot or grasping at straws. "The youngest was nine-year-old Sherdavia Jenkins, who was killed in the crossfire of a dispute in which the defendant unsuccessfully raised the Stand Your Ground defense." If they UNSUCESSFULLY raised the stand your ground defense, why the hell are we talking about it, and why are you using it to argue a point? This article is utter crap.
-----==----==---==-----
What a garbage article.  
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;Martin and Dunn are two of at least 26 children and teens who have died in Florida Stand Your Ground cases.

No. Martin died in a Florida **self defense** case. The defense did not raise any stand-your-ground arguments; there was no SYG hearing; no SYG immunity was conferred. Yes, the jury instructions included SYG language because the SYG language is part of Florida's self-defense law. The jury instructions also included language on Florida's Castle Doctrine, which did not apply either.  All Florida self-defense cases include SYG and Castle Doctrine language, regardless of whether SYG or Castle Doctrine actually play a role in the case.

Most of the rest of these cases, the defendant unsuccessfully tried to polish a turd: claiming self-defense and/or SYG when their actions were indisputedly criminal. The accused is entitled to a rigorous defense, where they will try to shoehorn their actions into the limits of the law. Most fail. Spectacularly. 

Edit: the Daniel Ardmore case wasn't even stand your ground, it was a Castle Doctrine case. It occurred in the defendant's home after 18-year-old Ardmore attacked the defendant, left the home, smashed a window, and then again attacked the now-armed defendant. It was castle doctrine that removed the defendant's duty to retreat, not SYG.

Fox news is basically a conspiracy theorist news station. Everything is a "distraction" from whatever it is they want people to believe is real.

The real trick is that there is no conspiracy; the "distraction" is itself a "distraction". #distractception.

As I understand it, recess appointments to NLRB are under consideration by SCOTUS...

[Supreme Court casts skeptical eye on Obama's appointment power](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/13/us-usa-court-appointments-idUSBREA0C13120140113)

The reason this rule was knocked down in court, before, in 2011, was that the NLRB lacked a forum (due to Republicans and their Chamber sponsors adamantly blocking pro-labor appointments).

Go figure...

I think selling cigarettes is a bit like selling gasoline.  The corporation producing the product makes a lot of money, but the guy you hand your money to is getting pennies and making his living off products you pick up as an add-on.  Cigarettes are so highly taxed and people who smoke them tend to do so regularly, so they learn to return again and again to the cheapest places to buy them.  There's a big incentive for most stores to sell them as cheaply as they can to attract those people and hope they pick up a candy bar as well.  But what if that's not the niche you fill?  For CVS, the time it takes to get cigarettes from behind the glass cases they keep them in could compromise the speed of the lines and decrease people's perception that CVS is a place to grab something fast, losing them more business than they gain.

TL;DR I don't think this is a humanitarian move, but a profit-driven one.

I see that it might not hurt their bottom line in the long run, but I don't understand why this adds value.  No one is in the dark that cigarettes are bad.

tobacco sales were banned from pharmacies in ontario 20 years ago. had very little impact on overall sales in the stores even tho they originally complained that they would have to lay off people and shut down stores. never happened.

I dream of one day seeing a pharmacy that sold absolutely no deliberately harmful products or flimflam/pseudoscience of any kind.  Only real medicine, that'd be so nice.

Feels like a stretch. The article assumes both won't be possible, but I'm not sure why. 

I think of it like this- If you find yourself in need of stitches, trying to stop the bleeding on the way to the ER is good policy. The ER is farther away, and will cost a lot more, but ultimately be much more effective. The bandaid you put on in the meantime won't solve the problem, but it was never meant to. It's meant to help the problem a little bit until it can be addressed correctly and completely.

"Reality has a well-known liberal bias."

Most of these things are things conservatives/republicans *used to* also believe in previous decades.  Republicans/conservatives have just moved so far to the right now that they are basically economic anarchists.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt; People to the left of econ 101 will typically invoke the phrase "political economy" to explain why, for example, econ 101 underrates labor unions. Conversely those to the right of econ 101 will instead invoke the phrase "public choice" to explain why, for example, econ 101 overrates utility regulation. But in both cases the critics are saying the same thing, namely that the moderately liberal policies advocated by introduction to economics textbooks are ignoring certain realities of institutional design, practical politics, power dynamics, etc. And that's why policy debates are so endless and so fascinating.

Then why is it being taught? If it's wrong, change it or include the nuances, then use that new teaching. Otherwise decisions are made on interest rather than predictable causal relationships.

It's very dangerous to get too caught up in this MSNBC vs. FOX thing.  These rivalries are more about getting ratings and increasing their bottom lines, not about being more truthful or accurate.

It's far more important for our younger generation to become independent, critical thinkers willing to watch news from a variety of sources.  Just as I'd want FOX viewers to check other sources, I'd want MSNBC viewers to do the same.  That would be far better for our democracy than more people watching MSNBC than FOX.

Jerry should be ashamed of himself - a decent (white) comedian has at least some sense of white guilt and humility when it comes to race relations. We as progressives should bond together closely and do our best to put him out of business.
