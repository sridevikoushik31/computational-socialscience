I want to see the response of the right to this.  I doubt the Scottish Sun or the Daily Mail will be particularly pleased about this.  "GAY?  AND AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS?".  That's roughly what I'm expecting.  The UKIP councilor who blamed the legalisation of gay marriage for the floods will probably flip flop on the party line on Scottish independence.

&gt;In August of last year, Colombian farmers launched large-scale demonstrations in opposition to Colombian trade policies that are strongly supported by the U.S. government..... 

&gt;The incidence of deaths in both Colombia and Venezuela, so far, is only slightly higher in Venezuela, with 13 deaths versus 12 deaths in Colombia.[ii] Yet there was not only very little coverage, and almost no criticism of the Colombian government as compared to the harsh attacks on the Venezuelan government in the U.S. media. 

&gt;As mentioned earlier, US Secretary of State John Kerry and President Obama made public statements regarding the protests in Venezuela. Both demanded that students arrested in Venezuela be released, without regard as to whether any had been arrested for allegedly committing crimes such as arson and assault. There were no such statements from U.S. officials regarding the hundreds arrested in Colombia.

The PSL in Denver is made up of pretty cool folks (I'm in the ISO). We have our disagreements- disagreements that we focus on while we read and discuss theoretical works- but we set those aside when it comes time for action and work together. To be honest, I really appreciate the way those folks approach discussion and disagreement while making it clear they still want to work on substantive issues. The Denver PSL are pretty much the opposite of sectarian and that's coming from someone comfortable describing themselves as a Trot.

I've never once heard a libertarian or even a staunch capitalist give an intelligent response to this question . . .

If my right to swing my fist ends at the tip of your nose, why doesn't my right to hoard material resources end at the point you go to bed hungry?

Mill is idolized by the least stupid subset of libertarians, but they selectively read his work.  I'm pretty sure the man would have appreciated how I framed the question above, and I'm pretty sure in both cases he would have suggested rights are extreme simply when taken near the extent of either example.  It's just that the "tip of your nose" thing is a very popular folksy thing libertarians say to each other because, to them, the sentiment embodies profound wisdom.

*Edited because I have no idea how to "swing my first."

What do people think of this. I know it predates Marx and so misses out anything that came from his analysis but I think he has a pretty interesting take on things.

"If some Nero or Domitian was to require a hundred persons to run a race for their lives, on condition that the fifty or twenty who came in hindmost should be put to death, it would not be any diminution of the injustice that the strongest or nimblest would, except through some untoward accident, be certain to escape."

forgive me for sounding anachronistic but i think tv is to blame to some extent.  

i love hearing stories from my father about how *his* grandparents were *appalled* at the impact television had on people.  we're talking the generation that grew up without electricity and for whom *radio* was something new.  they were completely freaked out that loving families would sit in the same room together, stare at a box and not say a word to each other.  people used to have *a lot* more social interaction and that's only getting worse with our generation.

I'm realizing this same experience.  My mother has become a very bitter Fox News enthusiast with no room for my left-leaning views on pretty much anything.  I'm at least happy to see that I'm not alone in my situation.  Perhaps one day I'll get her to listen to a little truth and reasoning... but it'll have to be after the plug is pulled on Fox.... at least in the house.

There is more going on here: our parents are susceptible to this nonsense in a way that we are not because of what happened in the 1980s.  The hopelessness that took over after the rebellions of the 1960s and 70s were crushed has fueled this.  Paranoia and hysteria are the normal human responses to hopelessness.

My uncle is exactly like this persons father. So much so that anyone who is liberal at all in our family just doesn't speak to him anymore.

Read Shirky's books *Here Comes Everybody* and *Cognitive Surplus* or Anderson's book *Makers*, and you'll see the Internet not just as a means of organizing national socialist political parities. There are completely new kinds of socialist like organizations working at a global scale on the Internet on top of capitalism. In many ways Reddit is socialist compared to a newspaper, and so is Wikipedia and countless open source software projects.

With 3D printing, we're seeing the means of production quickly becoming distributed, with open design files being shared on sites like Thingverse, and people manufacturing them in their homes and communities. The people are taking control of the means of production and the intellectual property. This isn't your grandpa's socialism, but I think it may very well turn into a socialist like revolution without anyone picking up a brick.

Trigger Warning: Article is a Telegraph.co.uk piece.

http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100260720/whenever-you-mention-fascisms-socialist-roots-left-wingers-become-incandescent-why/

Fascism being Right Wing is based on the deterioration of Capitalism. Once Capitalism reaches it's ultimate crisis there are only two options: Socialism or Fascism.

Fascism, in the historical sense, is the outgrowth of the failure of modern monarchism and nationalism. The Capitalist/Tradintionalist/Conservative/Nationalist/Bourgeoisie power bloc of France, Britain, Germany, Eastern Europe, etc lost its monopoly on power at the end of WWI in the face of an organized Socialist force throwing its weight into the democratic process, suffrage for women, etc. The formerly disenfranchised underclass realized its political power and the collapse of Imperialism/Capitalism at the end of WWI pressured the aforementioned Capitalist power bloc into synthesizing a way of governing that maintained their political power, social status, and quality of life. Thus the former monarchists and bourgeoisie classes rallied behind Fascist ideologies.

Remember, the Nazi's disliked traditional Capitalism because they viewed Capitalism as a Jewish Conspiracy. The Nazi's also did not abolish class lines, but instead reinforced them and defended the rights of private property. Farms were organized by private committee that set its own price controls. I often see comparisons between Nazi Germany's Economy and that of the USA during the Great Depression. Also keep in mind that the Socialist elements of the Nazi party were actually liquidated in mass executions.

So, essentially, Fascism doesn't limit the capitalist mode of production, it merely reinforces it and its class nature but protects the small/national bourgeoisie class from the self consuming International Imperialist Capitalist. In this sense, it is right wing since Fascism is developed to protect traditionally right wing classes.

So, the guts of the article: Can Liberals become Fascists? Absolutely. One of the cornerstones of Marxism Leninism is that Liberal and Social Democratic blocs are not to be trusted specifically because of their predisposition towards Fascism in times of economic crisis.

The article's mistake is thinking that some how a Libertarian state is not authoritarian or total and that the existence of state is defacto a Leftist institution. There will always be a controlling power manifested in some form or fashion, be it a state controlled by socialists, a state controlled by the bourgeoisie, or a monopolistic private entity. The abolishment of the state will only result in a vacuum that will be filled by some controlling entity which will use state power to reinforce its position.

The author is naive if he thinks some type of Libertarian paradise would avoid this pitfall and seems to (purposefully?) forget that the eras of "less regulation" are the same eras that led to the absolute disasters such as WWI, Belgian Congo, and British &amp; Japanese Imperialism.

All I can think of is that quote commonly misattributed to Steinbeck:

&gt; "Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires."

The American Dream has been one of the most harmful and delusional ideologies in the history of the nation.

Is that ad for real? Cadillac are you so far from reality that you believe this is actually true? People work extremely hard and still can't manage to push their way above the poverty line. Wake up, life isn't all about frivolous material possessions. Owning an expensive car is probably the last thing on these people's minds.

That part about going up to the moon really frustrated me also. The only country even considering a manned mission to the moon at this point is China.

&gt; Should I just join Labour and the Co-op party?

Definitely not. I joined the Labour Party when I was 16, and it took me 2 and a half years to see the party for what they are today... I joined thinking of the fighting Labour Party of old, but it's nothing like that now, it's an undemocratic echo-chamber for the party leadership. 

I'm a member of the Socialist Party (England and Wales). We used to be known as Militant Tendency back in the 70's and 80's, when we were a group within the Labour Party... essentially we were the socialist left in Labour. We left in the early 90's, and founded the Socialist Party.

We're members of the the international called the Committee for a Worker's International (CWI), with active sections in around 60 different countries, making us one of the biggest in the world. 

We stand in elections under the banner of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC), which is a federation of socialist parties - we're standing hundreds of candidates across the country in the upcoming local elections, and expect to have enough candidates in the next general election for a Party Political Broadcast. 

I'm not saying "JOIN US!", but I would suggest you go along to a party meeting, or organise a discussion with one of our comrades, and test the waters. 

6 years ago I would have never have thought I'd be anywhere but the Labour Party, and now I'm my city's Youth and Student organiser for the Socialist Party. 

If you want, you can PM me your details and I can pass them on to the branch in your area, or you can use our website to get in touch: http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/main/contact

Avoid Labour unless you are incredibly charismatic.  I mean ridiculously so.  Talking Adolf Hitler levels of charisma here.  You'd need to be able to get to an influential position, and even then, the party is so far gone I doubt you'd be able to right it.

Since that's so unrealistic, you probably need to look for an alternative.  Look into the young [Left Unity](http://leftunity.org/).  They haven't existed for more than about 6 months, so not sure quite what they're like.  In my opinion, you should avoid the Respect Party.  They have some internal instability due to some fucked up shit that I won't go into.  So consider the [Green Party](http://www.greenparty.org.uk/), and hence, the [Alliance for Green Socialism](http://www.agstest.org.uk/).  Also look at the [Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition](http://www.tusc.org.uk/).  They're a coalition of Trotskyists, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  There's a [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_Kingdom#Minor_far_left_parties) if you want more.
-----==----==---==-----
Maybe Respect ? It seems like the most influential non Marxist leftist party in the UK. But I'm a Marxist and not British so do not take my word for that !
-----==----==---==-----
I'd honestly say that the 'middle class' is a term with a fairly marxist meaning: It's a petty capitalist, someone who owns some capital, like a family-run business, and is thus able to benefit from the fruits of their labor while doing comparatively little exploitation of others.

Or at least, I'd say that's what it meant a few decades ago. As the US economy has become progressively less equal under capitalist success, the standards for what it means to be 'middle class' has fallen until it's basically a term for 'working class, but I'd much rather pretend I'm not an impoverished and exploited member of the proletariat, please'. "Small businessman" has replaced the term's original usage.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm middle class, you're middle class, we're all middle class! Good news! You thought you were exploited at work, huh? But did you know that you and your boss are all part of the same middle class who are working together to provide for your families. Even Warren Buffet, with his billions of dollars still lives in a comfortably small $250,000 house because he is middle class just like you. Did you know that President Obama is black? Guess what, he too is middle class. In fact everyone in the world is middle class so there is no need for any of this silly "class warfare" those commies go on about. There is no such thing because there is only one class, the middle class.

(Except for those god damn lazy minorities with their welfare taking the hard earned money of honest working class joes like you, me and Lloyd Blankfein)

**edit:** More seriously, in a Marxist sense, the middle classes are those that occupy a space somewhere outside of the direct conflict of the Bourgeoisie and Proletariat. Even most doctors are technically working class because they live on selling their labor-power to a hospital. The middle classes are the petty bourgeois (or small business owners who own capital but still have to work) and the lumpenproletariat (criminals, people outside the labor market, etc). But the way its used by bourgeois politicians is the way I described in my rant above.
-----==----==---==-----
Like most liberal categories, middle class is a useless term.  It's definition varies by time (inflation) and location.  In the UK it's both a caste and a pejorative term, in America a catch-all used to blur the distinction between the petit bourgeoisie and labour aristocracy.  Better to use class distinctions which refer to people's relationship to the economy, since classes based on culture (UK) or wage in geographical context (US) are subjective nonsense.

I'd be curious as to how non-English speakers define the term, as I'd expect it to change in order to support whichever methods a nation uses to divide the working class (eg the British caste system or the American dream)

So if you consider your purpose to be the realization of socialism, what would you do if that actually happened? Wouldn't you be in the same boat as everyone who thinks "this is it, what else is there?". Plenty of studies of the rich and well to do who have nothing they need to achieve show they're just as empty if not more than the very people they live of off. To think of the point of life in terms of goals that need achieving, purpose, is pretty much to state that life isn't worth living for its own sake, and inevitable leads to suffering.

As far as it goes, I think eastern philosophy has an actual answer with practical results. Do what you like and will, but enjoy doing it regardless of any goal being realized or not. Getting stuck in the mode of thinking of what should be yet isn't, is to cause yourself unnecessary suffering. Everyone falls into this trap due to the culture of value, everything must have utility for something else, but what happens when there is nothing else to gain? Do you seriously just sit down and die of boredom, can you really not enjoy that you're simply alive? If you fail to achieve ideal goals, do you really just sit down and cry about how bad things are and how life isn't like the idea you thought up?

Alienation isn't just from the means of production and control of our lives. Marx himself in his theory of alienation realized that humans are alienated from their own selves, a problem which eventually has to be faced even in socialist society. It's really striking how much in common Hegelianism and Marxism arrive at very similar fundamental conclusions of the world as eatern mystical philosophy did.
-----==----==---==-----
Capitalism destroys us, and it is incredibly effective at it.

I feel that it's a combination of everything you outlined. Several of my parents old friends were socialists in their youth (they still are ideologically). For a lot of socialists, the pressures of living in a capitalist society catch up with them; if you want to have a family, you need to work and can't afford to spend your time being an agitator. I image that for some it would be a developing sense of powerlessness as years go by without any struggle breaking out, or seeing opportunities to take the struggle further go to waste, being politically isolated without a party wouldn't help.
-----==----==---==-----
There are a few questions here, but I'll try to give a general answer to what I think is a general question. 

I have learned to very careful in what I invest my identity into. I take a lot of time to think out my goals and the many different paths leading to and from those goals.

I'm not sure how well I will be understood in saying this, but I am an existentialist. This means that I find that a life on earth and the universe has no intrinsic meaning nor purpose. The fact that I am alive and have conciseness is completely absurd; my existence is random and temporary. This was a scary conclusion to come to, especially since all I'd ever know is life with a purpose, with a belief structure, such as religion, nationalism, or ethnocentrism. But now I find it very liberating. 

This philosophical view lends itself to three options; suicide, denial, or acceptance of the absurdity of reality. The latter of which I have chosen (obviously). This then leads to developing a purpose for one's existence.

I have chosen humanism, because at some point it occurred to me that all my favorite things were made and/or thought of by people. I'm not much of a naturalist, although I have no qualms with the ideology, I just prefer humans to nature.

This is only the outline, but it helps to give context to what I am about to say. Have faith in humanity. It isn't always easy to keep the faith, and it can be blinding if one is not careful, but I have found this faith to be the only one worth keeping.
-----==----==---==-----
Everybody will have different answers to this question and in reality the answers lies less in socialist theory and more in your own personal circumstances. 

In my opinion though it's all about opportunity. We do not know exactly when or if a society in which we live will become socialist but if it does it will have less to do with individual agency and more to do with institutional forces creating the conditions for it to happen. I feel that the role of any one individual in this process is like that of drift wood in the sea. Your ultimate destination is decided by the tide and not your own decisions. So in my opinion the fact that I am socialist have little effect on this feeling of being lost we experience as we reach adult hood.

Why Unions Fail

The SLP maintains that today’s unions are dedicated to principles that run counter to the best interests of the workers. That’s why they fail to unite the workers and why they become obstacles to workers’ efforts to defend themselves against ruthless exploitation. They call themselves unions, but they are not based on the principle of working-class unity. They divide workers instead of uniting them.

Corruption has followed inevitably. Most union leaders started out as sincere and honest people, but the harsh realities of capitalism quickly disillusioned them. The more hopeless the plight of the rank and file appeared, the more the union leaders turned to feathering their own nests. Careerists and opportunists rose to the top, exploiting the workers’ instinct for solidarity to promote their own bureaucratic interests as labor merchants of the capitalist class of labor exploiters. In strike after strike, the unions have sacrificed and bartered away the workers’ interests in exchange for such things as the “union shop” and the dues “checkoff” that practically make the capitalist employer a union official and dues collector. And they seal these deals with labor contracts that tie workers’ hands and that capitalists often break.

This is corruption of the worst kind. It perverts the historic mission of unionism.

Edit: I should mention that the same Berman is behind many of the anti-union websites, campaigns, etc. in the USA too. Always the same rhetoric. Luckily you can WHOIS sites and see who registered them.

This is pretty weak stuff even if you think being a Marxist is evil. 8/600 can be quoted as saying something that can be construed as pro-socialism at some point in their bodies of work. 45% aren't specialists in labour economics. That leaves at least 322 they haven't got anything on.

EDIT - Corrected bad maths.

&gt;Selective quoting

Cheap-laborists are getting desperate...
-----==----==---==-----
They aren't even trying anymore. "Wage hikes"? Changing the minimum wage to $10 is hardly a "hike". In the UK we have a minimum wage of about $10.52 for people over 21 and $8.39 for 18 - 20 year olds. Do we have unemployment? Sure but it isn't that much higher than US employment. So what is the big deal?

85% of economists have to subscribe to neoliberal economic theories to gain any appreciable income... That they agree with you is due to the invisible hand putting an all too real gun to their heads.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt; "The particular model of socialism pioneered by the Soviet Union undoubtedly brought significant economic and social progress..."

Isn't this a fairly uncontroversial statement for any sober economist who isn't a neo-feudal reactionary? Say what you will about Stalin on a political or humanitarian level, but the rapid transformation of Russia from the undeveloped agrarian empire of the Tsars to the modern industrial state of Khrushchev was a pretty big deal. Besides, surely any neoliberal economists who are OK with the likes of Deng or Pinochet should be well-practiced in blinding themselves to political/human rights in order to focus on economic development.

-----==----==---==-----
I don't even understand how this ad is supposed to be effective. How does being Marxist (or any of those other things) detract from any of their arguments on raising the minimum wage? If anything, these listed credentials strengthen their credibility by demonstrating that they have substantial economic experience.

This is insane.

104 comments and nobody is refuting the study cited in this ad?  [It was 2006 Neumark and Wascher](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663), I'm digging my claws into it now.

He is right. Just think of the concept of free speech. In the best democracy you are free to write a pamphlet titled "our government sucks" and spread it to the streets, but if you to write a pamphlet titled "our boss sucks" and spread it to your co-workers you will get your ass fired. It looks normal because are so used to it and we learn to deal with it by self-censoring, but it's pretty much as anti-democratic as the other case.

-----==----==---==-----
Here's my problem. People need apparently to lord it over each other. Our society is designed in a way to stratify, it's either in our nature, or we've been brought up to believe that life isn't worth living, if you can't put someone in their place. We worship individuals when it's actually the collective that achieves and we never ever question hierarchy when really we should constantly be questioning hierarchy. Leaders aren't necessarily a bad thing, they can organize ideas and talents in a focused manner, but the problem is, we don't have leaders nowadays, we have self-proclaimed rulers who believe that because they're on top, everyone else owes them... everything apparently. What they don't understand is that we let people be bosses, we allow them to be kings, presidents and CEO's. The reason for that is focused achievement, but instead it's actually to boost their ego and wealth. They're not better or smarter than most people, they're just luckier and have no qualms about cheating.

&gt;They appeal for order, for trust in, for submission to those who, in the course and in the name of the Revolution, seized and legalized their own dictatorial powers; this is how such political revolutionaries reconstitute the State. We, on the contrary, must awaken and foment all the dynamic passions of the people. We must bring forth anarchy, and in the midst of the popular tempest, **we must be the invisible pilots guiding the Revolution, not by any kind of overt power but by the collective dictatorship of all our allies, a dictatorship without tricks, without official titles, without official rights, and therefore all the more powerful, as it does not carry the trappings of power.** This is the only dictatorship I will accept, but in order to act, it must first be created, *it must be prepared and organized in advance, for it will not come into being by itself, neither by discussions, nor by theoretical disputations, nor by mass propaganda meetings*...

The proletariat needs an organization of violence to suppress the resistance of the exploiters. This organization should be composed of as many armed proletarians as possible, not "a privileged minority of conceited intellectuals". This is an absurd strawman of Marx.
-----==----==---==-----
Call me when the people tell us what they want, because history has pretty much shown that they have no clue after the moment of action. That's pretty much why the elite rises in the first place, the people get bamboozled precisely because they 1) don't know what it is that they really want 2) they don't really know how to do it even when they have a clue of what they want.

Zizek is a joke, but I do think he's right when he criticizes the people for not really knowing what they want, only that they want something different in hopes that different will be enough for it to be better. It's why liberals are so popular, it's the easy way to make a difference without actually doing much about making a real difference.

Bakunin's statement is a good one, albeit idealist moral garbage imo, funny that he himself was plainly more elitist and authoritarian than Marx ever was.

In general, these protesters represent the class of oligarchic capitalists that have ruled Venezuela -- with full support of the US -- for decades.

They -- and the US -- have established dictatorships, neo-fascist military regimes, and other rightist governments in the past. Now that democracy is blooming in Venezuela, they're not only out of power, but they're *pissed.*

Edit: Downvotes but yet no comments, critique or rebuttal. Sad, though par for the course for Reddit.
-----==----==---==-----
where exactly did you get this notion? especially "*the government should not do anything to help the poor*"? i want to see one instance where the venezuelan opposition *and* protesters, two starkly separate groups, complain about the social investment that has marked the entire chavez era. one thing is to believe the corporate greed is after the venezuelan riches, but what you're asserting here is something else entirely.

&gt;what do you think happens next?

In the Ukraine I think that Russia will intervene and the country will split with the Crimea becoming a Russian region. In Venezuela sadly I think the Government will take a more authoritarian approach to protesters and may lose them support. In the next election I think the government will lose power. 

&gt; Was Yanukovych's ousting a proper response to the Ukrainian people's calls for integration into the EU, or was it an illegal coup that should never have happened?

Yankuovych made his presidency illegitimate by passing increasingly authoritarian laws which damaged the democratic credentials of the country. The people should always hold power. Because of the actions of there president they were losing it and had to take action to gain it back.

[The Non-Libertarian FAQ (aka Why I Hate Your Freedom)](http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html)

It's not a perfect response, but it presents some logical avenues to attack orthodox ancapism. The coordination problem discussion is particularly useful.

Also, own the definition of socialism. Don't let your opponent define it. Shock the listeners I suppose? Come up with a short definition and keep repeating it every time you get a chance. Keep bringing your argument back to something short and memorable. If you can, stuff the audience with a few sympathetic fellow travelers to clap at appropriate moments.

Debate "winners" are usually just the person who the listeners remember speaking the most.
-----==----==---==-----
If they're an ancap based on a deontological ethical view, you're probably never going to convince *them*, but you can persuade the audience by showing where their moral system produces results that would be absurd to most people: I'm a fan of Singer's "drowning child" argument, personally. 
-----==----==---==-----
DMTMH, listen. Ancaps, as far as I know, love freedom. 

As far as they know, being an ancap is the best way to achieve personal and individual freedom. 

Just simply argue, that socialism through the means of which you believe in, is the best way to liberate the working class and humanity as a whole. Point out that in the end you two are both looking for the same end but through different means. 

I don't have much in the way of speaches and statistics to give you, but I do have that advice to give you and to tell you to keep in mind when debating him. Know that's what his whole philosiphy revolves around and that it is the centerpoint for his arguments. Use this to your advantage and argue that your way is much less oppressive to the overall majority because in a free market, no one is held accountable for their actions, and it is much easier to exploit those less fortunate than you. 

The other thing I just remembered, he'll make points about the NAP (non agression principle) but just shoot that down by telling him that it's unrealistic to think that all humans will voluntarily abide by the nonaggression principle and that no one will use coercion. 

So just keep that in mind when debating him. Good luck and godspeed. 
-----==----==---==-----
Anarcho-capitalism, as I see it, is an oxymoron.

An anarchist seeks lack of class distinction and equality. Capitalism seeks ownership of wealth by the few and works to keep inequality in existence.

How the hell can these two things be one?!

Hope this has helped.

It is my duty to help you, as a fellow socialist.
-----==----==---==-----
Check out anarchopac's YouTube channel. He has a lot of good videos that criticize anarcho-capitalism philosophically, ethically, economically, etc. from an anarchist perspective. It'll definitely be useful for you, especially when the issue of "self-ownership" comes up. 
-----==----==---==-----
I spend most of my reddit time on /r/DebateAnarchism these days and I've seen plenty of ancaps argue of this stuff. Some arguments you'll want to anticipate:

* But taxation / the state / planned economies / being forced to work for a coop instead of a capitalist isn't voluntary!*
* [Rationally ignorant voters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance)
* Time-value of money justifies profits accruing in the boss' hands
* Why don't the workers just buy the companies or work for a coop themselves?
* [Economic calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem) for the planned sectors of the economy
* If you have financial markets, [the ABCT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_business_cycle_theory)

As for resources, I'd like to point out that there is currently an AMA for the [NAP-type of ancaps right now](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/1ym1cy/deontological_anarchocapitalism_ama) and will be having another starting March 22 for the consequentalist ancaps if you want to prod their minds for anything you wish. Because the ancaps we've got over in /r/DebateAnarchism are well-trained and can differentiate between markets &amp; capitalism, you can even start a new thread asking them to debate as practice.

--------------------------------------------

*Most ancaps take the NAP as a rule of thumb but if they're getting dogmatic and won't budge an inch with it, you can point out how it can break down at it's extremes by [quoting Rothbard himself](https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/fourteen.asp) and demonstrate that the NAP means nothing if it leads to a crummy reality (although honestly, dropping this is a bit overkill).

&gt;Applying our theory to parents and children, this means that a parent does not have the right to aggress against his children, but also that the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights. The parent therefore may not murder or mutilate his child, and the law properly outlaws a parent from doing so. But the parent should have the legal right not to feed the child, i.e., to allow it to die. The law, therefore, may not properly compel the parent to feed a child or to keep it alive. (Again, whether or not a parent has a moral rather than a legally enforceable obligation to keep his child alive is a completely separate question.) This rule allows us to solve such vexing questions as: **should a parent have the right to allow a deformed baby to die (e.g., by not feeding it)? The answer is of course yes**, following a fortiori from the larger right to allow any baby, whether deformed or not, to die. (Though, as we shall see below, in a libertarian society ***the existence of a free baby market will bring such “neglect” down to a minimum.)***

Edit: I almost forgot, [here's](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2013/12/the-nap-isnt-a-knock-down-argument-for-libertarianism/) a great article, by a libertarian, about how the NAP isn't a lock tight argument if you want to be a spoilsport and not drag baby markets into the debate.
-----==----==---==-----
Read /r/anarchfeudalism it rather satirically shows the flaws of anarcho capitalism.
-----==----==---==-----
Point out the inherent contradiction in their ideology - Private property requires aggression to remain private thus violating the NAP.
-----==----==---==-----
Just tell him he is a silly idealist and that society will never run according to principles but according to underlying economic conditions and that's why the NAP is irredeemably stupid and read him passages from Marx' The Holy Family to rub it in and so on
-----==----==---==-----
Remember to focus on the relationship between property and force, property is subjective and arbitrarily designated and *always* predicated by force, the idea that the six members of the Walmart family have any more right to own more wealth than a third of Americans is ridiculous and could only exist in a system in which their vast and wide holdings are protected by a state.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;Are there some speeches or debates I should watch to take example from? What are some good resources I should use for research? Does anyone have experience in debates with AnCaps?

You must, MUST learn about the Cambridge Capital Controversies, if you haven't already. The only theory of profit ancraps have is marginal productivity theory and it was *demolished* *decades* ago. Geoff Harcourt has written a lot on this. See his collection of essays [here](http://www57.zippyshare.com/v/77997477/file.html). [Here's](http://www.paviauniversitypress.it/scientifica/download/Lazzarini-2011-03-21.pdf) another book on it, and [another](http://www17.zippyshare.com/v/26280773/file.html).

-----==----==---==-----
Why would any sane person bother to discuss with an AnCap?

The big bad government is the root of inequality, but somehow the private ownership of property isn't?  The free market works to make everyone equal despite the fact that having more capital means one has more wealth and more exploitative powers...  But the market will balance everything out and make the world a perfect place.

Charity will take care of the poor more than entitlements
Capitalism raises the standard of living for all

&gt;I began to wonder what a company worker looked like. I found it hard to come up with an image. Amazon’s workforce is made up mainly of computer engineers and warehouse workers, but when you think of Amazon you don’t picture either one (and there aren’t many photographs to help your imagination). What you see, instead, is a Web site with a button that says “ADD TO CART” and a cardboard box with a smile printed on the side. Between clicking “BUY” and answering the door when U.P.S. arrives lies a mystery—a chain of events that only comes to mind if you make a conscious effort. The work is done by people you don’t see and don’t have to think about, which is partly what makes Amazon’s unmatched efficiency seem nearly miraculous.

&gt;The invisibility of work and workers in the digital age is as consequential as the rise of the assembly line and, later, the service economy. Whether as victim, demon, or hero, the industrial worker of the past century filled the public imagination in books, movies, news stories, and even popular songs, putting a grimy human face on capitalism while dramatizing the social changes and conflicts it brought. The guy stocking shelves and the girl scanning purchases at Target never occupied much of a place in the public mind, and certainly never a romantic one (no one composed a “Ballad of the Floor Associate”), but at least you had to look at them whenever you ventured out to stimulate the economy. They reminded you that low-priced Chinese-made goods were a mixed blessing—that many of the jobs being created in post-industrial America were crappy ones.

&gt;With work increasingly invisible, it’s much harder to grasp the human effects, the social contours, of the Internet economy.

Hitler basically took over a small political party he'd run across (he was still in the German Army at the time, and his job at the time was to spy on the new little parties popping up everywhere, and report back any that seemed dangerous).  It happened to already be named the *Deutsche Arbeiterpartei* (German Workers' Party).  In 1920, party member Rudolf Jung suggested a name change to *Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei* (National Socialist German Worker's Party), with the explicit aim of broadening the party's appeal.  (Hitler didn't officially become leader of the party until 1921.)

There were some elements in the early NSDAP (common to many of the new parties that popped up like mushrooms after WWI) that opposed the excesses of capitalism (which dovetailed well with the anti-Semitism that was also there from day one).  And the early NSDAP **did** have platform planks that included "abolition of unearned incomes" and "the State to share profits from land."  But they were pretty much **always** anti-Marxist and anti-communist.  One group of members wanted to merge with the German Socialist Party, but that idea was quashed very quickly.

The problem now is that right-wing nutbars in the US (Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, many many others) are going out of their mind because "there's an N-word in the White House!"  They want to tar and feather Obama and his reputation with every slur they can think of.  Since these people commonly use "socialism" as an epithet (the Tea Party is, basically, the John Birch Society v.2), they like to call Obama "socialist".  But they also want to paint him as a dictator.^1  So they latch onto the "Socialist" bit of the NSDAP name, and say "Obama is a socialist; Hitler was a socialist too, so Obama = Hitler!"  It's complete shite, of course, but Americans have never shown themselves to be too reluctant to ingest whatever shite the owners feed them.

^1 Of course, if Obama really **were** a dictator, Beck, Limbaugh, and everyone behind Fox News would've been taken out back and summarily shot years ago.  Which, I suggest, would have made a great improvement to the USA, but that's another story....

it's not a complicated concept.  for all those who wish to claim nazis were socialists, they need to explain why socialists and communists were put in the camps alongside jews, roma &amp; homosexuals and why the invasion of europe was explained as a defense against the onslaught of bolshevism.

Wait, there are people who think Hitler was a socialist? Anti-semitism *came from* anti-socialsim and anti-Karl Marx beliefs. Key leaders in the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks (Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev), as well as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were Jewish (or had jewish heritage), the anti communist sentiment in conservative Germany (and the Nazi party are probably the most conservative political group ever) was the cause of the disdain for 'jewish intellectuals'.

Hitler hated communists more than Jews. He despised Stalin and his hatred for the Russians motivated him to attack Russia, leading to the German defeat.

I keep using this example too many times in reddit, but here goes:

The National Socialist party was as much Socialist, as much as the *Democratic* People's Republic of Korea is *Democratic*. It is NOT Democratic at all, not even in Marxism as they reject it.

Parties use the word "Socialism" or "Worker" because those concepts are really popular outside of America. It doesn't mean that they represent any of those words though.

the comments turned out better than I thought they would, though

"Socialism" at the time when the Third Reich started was basically a term for anti-capitalist revolutionary political thought. If you add expansionism and ethnocentrism to that basic framework, you get National Socialism. 

It fits the definition, it's just not the kind of socialism we like. For us to say National Socialism did not fit the definition of socialism is like a supporter of drug prohibition saying caffeine does not fit the definition of "drug." 

That being said, Fuck Hitler.
-----==----==---==-----
I thought NAZI was National Socialists. I know he was extremely Anti-union and anti-communist. So I assume the socialist part was for propaganda's sake, or I could be wrong entirely. Please explain if so.
-----==----==---==-----
Who the fuck thinks Hitler of all people was actually a socialist? Unsubbed, you guys are fucking retarded.
-----==----==---==-----
Hitler, ladies and gents, was "social imperialist".

That is, socialist in description, totalitarian in practice.

It was very common in the 20th Century, and utilized as a means of evil men wishing to be dictators.

Stalin, Hitler, Mao, all North Korean leaders, as well as the fictional and indistinguishable ideologies of Ingsoc, Neo-Bolshevism, and Death-worship of "Nineteen-Eighty Four".

In truth, they couldn't be any further south of it.

In short, no he was not. It was simply a method of gaining support for his own power, and has been done many times by others in the same fashion.

Please read up on "social imperialism", epic_instance.

Also, remember this quote by Orwell:

"The object of power is power. The object of torture is torture. The object of persecution is persecution."

Are we clear?

I don't think I can make it any clearer than that.

**Main points**

* In 1975 15% of Venezuelans lived in poverty, two decades later it had surged to 45% 

* Under Chavez poverty rates collapsed from 50% to 25%, extreme poverty reduced by two-thirds

* Venezuela's gross national per capita income languished below the continent's average before Chavez, it is now higher than Brazil or Argentina ($13,120 against an average of $8,981)

* In 2012 Venezuela enjoyed region's biggest drop in poverty

* Inflation runs at over 50%, but in the 1990's it topped 100% which was not presented as a failure of free-market capitalism. 

* Law-and-Order exacerbated by Colombian civil war, guns, ineffective police force, corruption

* Government's support for Syrian and ex-Libyan regimes should not be overlooked

**On the opposition** 

* One of the leaders of current protests is Lopez, who was involved in 2002 coup and helped arrest Chavez's Interior Minister

* Steel wire has been fitted to Opposition barricades, and at least two people have been garotted

* All deaths must be investigated and those responsible held accountable. 

* Those loudest in cheering on often violent anti-government protests in Venezuela are those who would tolerate them least if they happened in this country (UK)

**On Chavez's/Government's democratic credentials**

* International observers have declared every election to be free

* Massive jump in number of registered voters (More than doubled)

* Jimmy Carter:"Venezuela's election process best in the world"

* State media biased in favour of government, but private media is dominant and remains biased in favour of opposition

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper#The_paradox_of_tolerance


&gt;Although Popper was an advocate of toleration, he said that intolerance should not be tolerated, for if tolerance allowed intolerance to succeed completely, tolerance itself would be threatened. In The Open Society and Its Enemies, he argued:

&gt;&gt;Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance.  **If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.** In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.[34][35][36][37]

Great article. As the author stated, Marx's philosophy and humanism has to be reclaimed and made use of. Part of what allows people who come to power in the name of communism/socialism/marxism to commit to some pretty shitty treatment of the people is forgetting that there is a human element at play besides the class struggle, and well...when you forget the human element you get shitty places all in the name of fighting the bogeyman of counter revolution.

As a native Mississippian this news makes me very sad, he seemed like such a ray of hope for both both the black community specifically and the proletariat in general. He knew the only way forward was to put more power in the hands of the working class and the surest way a politician could aid that effort would be to promote state support for worker cooperatives.

The actual technical development of society may be sufficient to pass over to the higher stage of communism immediately, but this historical movement is being forestalled by massive waste of social labor time. In the example I gave above, two thirds of the surplus value produced does not reenter capitalist production; the portion of the labor day that reenters capitalist production and allows expansion of the total capital is only the portion that can be employed productively as capital. The remaining portion cannot be employed productively and must be wasted.

I think anyone who thinks the new American "Left" will be socialist is highly mistaken. Yeah that would be great, but it seems clear that liberals are not becoming angry with the Democratic Party as much as they are claiming they need to get rid of groups like the New Democrats. They just want people like Bill De Blasio and Elizabeth Warren to be the new Democratic Party. Those are the types of people that are going to re-energize that party's base and make them think that the Party has finally gone to the Left because their candidates will be talking about single-payer healthcare and other vague populist ideas. I really don't think the Democrats are going to lose many people as they transition from where the Obama era to the "progressive" era.

This is pretty good and I agree with most of it.

But I felt he could have expressed all the same ideas in less words.

He also seemed rather dismissive and condescending towards the Occupy movement and the socialist for council campaign Seattle, which I didn't really appreciate. 

Overall pretty decent though.

This article, although long, repays reading. Its conclusion should resonate with a socialist forum: 

&gt; The crucial tasks for a committed left in the United States now are to admit that no politically effective force exists and to begin trying to create one. This is a long-term effort, and one that requires grounding in a vibrant labor movement. Labor may be weak or in decline, but that means aiding in its rebuilding is the most serious task for the American left. Pretending some other option exists is worse than useless. There are no magical interventions, shortcuts, or technical fixes. We need to reject the fantasy that some spark will ignite the People to move as a mass. We must create a constituency for a left program — and that cannot occur via MSNBC or blog posts or the New York Times. It requires painstaking organization and building relationships with people outside the Beltway and comfortable leftist groves. Finally, admitting our absolute impotence can be politically liberating; acknowledging that as a left we have no influence on who gets nominated or elected, or what they do in office, should reduce the frenzied self-delusion that rivets attention to the quadrennial, biennial, and now seemingly permanent horse races. It is long past time for us to begin again to approach leftist critique and strategy by determining what our social and governmental priorities should be and focusing our attention on building the kind of popular movement capable of realizing that vision.

I present this as a starting point for debate, rather than as something I completely agree with. I hope you find it interesting.

Ok I think I should have expresse myself better. I meant social classes as in, would a doctor earn more than a janitor in socialism ? if not then how much, approximately the same ? a big difference ?. I think what I'm specifically talking about is differences in wages, but I think they give rise to social classes. That's how my question arised
-----==----==---==-----
Even under relatively advanced socialism there would still be the proletariat, the peasantry, and the intelligentsia.

But I see what you're really asking about is differences in pay. This is a matter not of ideology, but of practicality--are large material incentives needed to boost production, how class-conscious is the working class? 

The orthodox Marxist understanding is that socialism distributes according to work (although no one should go hungry or homeless) and communism distributes according to need. 

&gt;“It is worth noting, therefore, that the idea that the social product should be equally divided amongst all has nothing to do with either socialism or communism. The social product is always unequally divided, first corresponding to unequal work and then corresponding to unequal needs. The equality which communism brings is the equal opportunity for everyone to develop all his capacities as a many-sided individual.” Maurice Cornforth, Historical Materialism p. 121

The transition is a delicate one, and the speed at which it should proceed depends on material conditions. Che Guevara's [Man and Socialism in Cuba](http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm) stresses the need to start early:

&gt;In moments of great peril it is easy to muster a powerful response with moral incentives. Retaining their effectiveness, however, requires the development of a consciousness in which there is a new scale of values. Society as a whole must be converted into a gigantic school.  

If you want to look at how this has been handled historically, you can look into the large rewards given to Stakhanovites and shock-workers under Stalin and contrast it to the use of moral incentives during the [Zafra.](http://faculty.mdc.edu/tpedraza/MMF-Ten%20Million%20Ton%20Harvest.htm) 

-----==----==---==-----
Classes aren't based on how much income you have, it is based on relation to the MOP. Socialism is a pre communist transition era. Its to ensure the eradication of all classes. The bourgeoisie still exist outside each socialist region if it isn't global, and the bourgeoisie of the old society might still exist as well. They won't own the MOP but they are still bourgeoisie as they would fight to retain their capital. So yes, in a way classes do exist.
-----==----==---==-----
Socialism is not "worker control of the means of production" as is commonly thought. That notion is fundamentally incoherent, it seeks to explain the workings of capitalism in terms of its management, but capitalism is not a mode of management, it is a mode of production. The particular form of production that capitalism takes is that of generalized commodity production, i.e. it tends to make all human activity and consumption mediated through market exchange and through this mediation creates wage labor and the state (which is nothing other than an anti-communist organization that protects networks of enterprise). So from this it is not enough to say that socialism is the "transition to communism" but instead it is the communization process itself, that is, it is replacing all forms of social mediation with the unmediated human community. So to finally get to the question of pay of doctors, yeah they might get payed a bit more at first, but fundamentally if there is not a general process taking place of destroying money (and thus the entire category of "pay") then socialism is not taking place.
-----==----==---==-----
From a pure definition viewpoint, a Class is something that is categorized apart from another something as there is a defining feature and/or difference.

For example, in an egalitarian society, plague can still occur. And then you have the two classes; plagued and healthy. However that is in reference to biology primary and economic/socioeconomic second. So it is absolutely different to social classes. Would it still effect the running of the world? Depends on the severity of the plague and where the power struggle falls between the classes in dealing with that issue.

Note: The above is my opinion as written at 1.30 am. Forgive me for any errors in grammar or logic.
-----==----==---==-----
Socialism is not a transitional stage. Socialism is a socio economic organisation of society. Communism is just one of its many variations.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;But since socialism is very much viewed as a transition to communism

Yeah but that doesn't make it true, regardless of how many people think it.  With Marxism you have capitalism and then communism, with no transitory thing called socialism.  This is a stalinist revision at an attempt to justify the non-communist and capitalist nature of the soviet union.  

There are no classes post-capitalism, this is the defining feature of post capitalism and communism.  It isn't just about eliminating wage differentials, it is about eliminating the whole of the wages system, which requires making the means of production common (which leads to, and accompanies) the negation of class society.  It isn't as if people, or an elected state/dictatorial state, can just implement one thing at a time.  That's idealist and utopian bullshit.

I'm Venezuelan, and agree that during last election there was sufficient coverage of both sides. That, however, has changed this year. This study is basin itself on old date, not taking into account the lack of coverage thus far of the opposition protests except by NTN24 (which was taken off air) and CNNEE (which was threatened with being taken off the air, and is still currently being planned as a replacement for the more government leaning ZumTV) 

Anyone care to discuss the truth here?

&gt; *President Nicolas Maduro’s administration wields unquestionable control over the Supreme Court, the Congress, the military and the oil industry -- the very institutions that could threaten his regime.” http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-02-25/venezuela-is-no-ukraine*

is he admitting that venezuela has a ridiculously centralized state? with maduro and the psuv having the ability of being 'legally' authoritarian without negative consequence? it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that a government with such control over everything would try to sell an image of unparalleled peachiness which might not reflect their country's actual reality.

&gt; *“The shortages are explained partly by speculation on the part of capitalists — just as happened in Chile in 1972 — and partly by the rising cost of imports, which make up a growing proportion of what is consumed in Venezuela”*

&gt; *Value of imports in 2012: US$47.310 billion*

&gt; *Value of imports in 2013: US$37.802
http://www.ine.gov.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=33*

&gt; *That is value of imports when down. In fact the value of imports in 2013 was higher in 2007, 2008 and 2009 than it was last year.*

so venezuela managed to import the same stuff if not more than previous years, *on a bargain*, according to this man. surely a lower figure of imports can't be interpreted as *less* imports which in turn [create shortages](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/10122) (*According to statements made by the Minister of Agriculture last month, Venezuela imports 50% of food consumed*), and the possibility of higher import costs [because of a distortion in the black market rate](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ykmvk/a_different_perspective_on_venezuela_is_there_any/cfljpxn?context=3), existing because of exchange controls that should be have been rescinded years ago and a series of frauds that are conveniently never solved (and still happen).

&gt; *“Today, those funds [oil wealth] are drying up as Venezuela’s oil income is diverted to paying for increasingly expensive imports.”*

&gt; *As I showed above imports are not more expensive. But its also not true that funds are drying up:*

&gt; *Value of exports 2012: US$97.340 billion. http://www.bcv.org.ve/Upload/Publicaciones/anuasectorexterno77-12.pdf?id=458*

this guy certainly likes to interpret numbers to his liking. no, venezuela isn't running out of oil, but they've been working on a budget, like every country does, for quite a bit and 2013's budget was highly distorted because of a series of questionable policies, as well as pressure from enemies of an administration that is still learning (hopefully it takes some intensive courses) to walk.

We live in a global capitalist economy. There is no way to avoid participation, and you are hardly a member of the capitalist class. But even members of the capitalist class have little choice but to act like it, it's the nature of the economy. A pairing of path dependency and the vicious nature of capitalist production keeps us participating in our roles until the moment when it is possible for society as a whole to overthrow and surpass capitalism. You're not selling your soul, your're surviving according to the material conditions of the economy you operate in. Keep being an adamant socialist and be loud about it. You can't be loud about it and effective if you're too poverty stricken to function in society.
-----==----==---==-----
You're not making these products any more valuable in any way before you sell them? 

By socialist logic, you're making a profit off of labor that is not your own. That is just what we consider exploitation. Although you don't employ those workers, you are an agent down the line in the productive process. 

On the other hand, supply and demand logic doesn't resonate. This would go on regardless of whether you're part of it, because demand is manufactured by the supply-side. 

&gt;How warped are my values?

Dunno. But I would say that where it's possible, you create your own value and don't depend on another worker's.  If you can somehow in your life acquire your own means of production, and produce your own things you should do that. 


-----==----==---==-----
I agree with kodiakus. This is the society that we live in right now. You gotta want man. We all do. It is nearly impossible to avoid being part of the system. It is setup to work that way.

If you buy an iPhone you're a part of it, if you clothes you're a part of it, if you buy fruits and vegetables....it's all the same. Besides the point isn't that it's made in other countries. The point is that the stuff you're selling is made by exploited workers right?  Can you name 1 product or service that isn't tied to exploitation?

Give yourself a break and educate people on socialism, speak about against injustices.

Fantastic post comrade. It always bugs me when people use the term fascist to describe the institutions of capitalist states - prisons, police, and suppression of dissent are all used by capitalist nations to maintain hegemony. When bourgeois oppression is referred to as fascism, it masks the brutality of capitalism and misrepresents the reality of class struggle.

Fascism, as you described very well, is a very unique phenomenon that saw its peak in the 1930's. Even Franco's regime, especially post WW2,  lacked adherence to the principles of fascism expounded here, adopting many free market economic reforms and forgoing ideological monolithism in favor of simpl(er) political repression. Today fascism is dead as a ruling ideology, but we can see its popularity increasing in many places, such as Greece(Golden Dawn) and Ukraine(Svoboda). 


-----==----==---==-----
When I see these goons bloviating about the nation and how much they 'love' Ukraine, even when they use big words, I can only think of this thing that Dostoevsky wrote: *As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.* It is very depressing to me to think that the destruction of capitalism is inhibited by people who fantasize about vikings, swords, and Conan the Barbarian and think this constitutes a political cause. There is no non-ideological reason why communism/leftism and liking vikings and swords can't go together. Of course there are serious (or real) fascists who actually think about society in a more sober manner, but most fascists or so-called fascists are just caught in ideological woo bullshit, in vacuous idealism.
-----==----==---==-----
Brilliant post. A great contribution. People throwing 'Fascism' around is one of my pet peeves. Far to often in this sub the word Fascism is used synonymously with Authoritarianism or oppression. 

In my view Fascism is not an ideology. It was a movement, driven by a call to action rather than a shift towards a different ontology, that occurred in the inter-war period as a result of systemic circumstances. For this reason, practically all the attempts to replicate the movement have since failed and only stand a chance of succeeding when similar circumstances arise, Greece for example. 

Thank  you for a great read and an informative post.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;What is the real thrust of fascism, if not the economic and political unification of capital, a tendency which has become general since 1914? Fascism was a particular way of bringing about that unity in countries--Italy and Germany-- where, even though the revolution had been snuffed out, the state was unable to impose order, including order in the ranks of the bourgeoisie. Mussolini was no Thiers, with a solid base of power, ordering regular armed forces to massacre the Communards. An essential aspect of fascism is its birth in the streets, its use of disorder to impose order, its mobilization of the old middle classes half-crazed by their own decline, and its regeneration, from without, of a state unable to deal with the crisis of capitalism . Fascism was an effort of the bourgeoisie to forcibly tame its own contradictions, to turn working-class methods of mass mobilization to its own advantage, and to deploy all the resources of the modern state, first against an internal enemy, then against an external one. 

from [When Insurrections Die](http://prole.info/texts by Gilles Dauve/insurrectionsdie.html)
-----==----==---==-----
This is a really good analysis, however I sincerely disagree with one statement:

&gt; Wherever a politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of a parliament because it no longer represents the Voice of the People, we can smell Ur-Fascism.

In the United States, our legislative system is *barely* representative of our needs, if at all. Instead, it tends to represent the corporations that have co-opted and bought it. It is a socialist critique to point this out, not a fascist one, and I think some distinction needs to be made here. Politicians that cast doubt on the ability for a parliament to represent their people in any capacity may be advocating for fascism, or the deconstruction of democratic structures. However, politicians observing that the current parliamentary system doesn't represent the people are not necessarily advocating for fascism, but observing one of any number of problems that may be plaguing a political system.

Aside from that, I think you did an excellent job summarizing the elements of fascism and how it manifests.

Pretty poor post, seems like you're just repeating tropes for up votes.  The three links you have are from around the 30s and I'm not even sure if Umberto is a marxist, especially if we are to go by his 14 points here.  If anyone wants to have a nice understanding of what fascism is in relation to democracy, revolution and it's development then they should definately have a look at [When Insurrections Die](http://www.prole.info/texts/insurrectionsdie.html) by Dauve.  
-----==----==---==-----
This is not a novel view, but it can be a divisive one. It's called [market socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism). Some socialists believe in a state under control by the working class which owns the means of production, while others do not, and some with a mix of state and non-state enterprises that are all still under worker control as the common denominator.
-----==----==---==-----
Influence in government will be important to help us achieve our goals. But as a main focus of activity it seems to be a bit of a dead end, at least in the US.  Probably because we don't have any real underlying power in the society to back us up. Our main focus ought to be grassroots organizing in the workplace and at the community level to build power. We ought to be encouraging more collective ownership of companies because that's where the real source of power comes from is ownership of production. So to answer your question it doesn't always need to be the government owning everything. Many companies would be more appropriately controlled by the people who work there, or some other non-government community cooperative. 

-----==----==---==-----
IMO, the key here is democratic accountability. A private group is not democratically accountable. It is only accountable so much as government regulates it to be so. On the other hand, an organisation which is owned publicly through the state is accountable through the state to the people. It exists for reasons other than just making a profit and it exists as part of the wider tapestry which comprises the state. It is not battling to stay solvent, to make a profit or to survive. Instead it is battling to fulfil the demands which are placed on it by the people through the state. The only interest of a national health service is to provide a health service. The only interest of a private health service is to make profit. 

Now there are several problems with collectively owned private enterprise. Through what mechanism do those that collectively own it maintain control over the organisation? Perhaps it is possible because the size of the group which collectively own it is small enough, in which case market forces enter into the equation and the service which people receive is based on what collective they happen to belong to, their geographical location, and the financial resources of those who collectively own the organisation. Then the care, or service or resources people receive become subjected to market forces rather than being based on there needs. 

On the other hand, if it where collectively owned by the entirety of the relevant population without the use of the state then all you have is less accountability, less oversight and more corruption.

Don't forget the United Fruit Company (Chiquita) - who got the CIA to bring a coup to the democratically elected Arbenz government of Guatemala  - who ran a campaign of land reform which would threaten neocolonialist landholders and capitalist oligarchs (2% owned 70% of the land) -  to install a pro-business dictator. Allen Dulles, from the UFC's board of trustees, had just been appointed director of CIA a year prior; his brother, John Foster Dulles, was also The United States' Secretary of State.    
  
For fun, [here's a memo](http://i.imgur.com/0cFFVnS.jpg) from the then US Ambassador to Colombia communicating the exploits of the United Fruit Company in Colombia.   
  
And that's just the [tip of the iceberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Wars) regarding the [UFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company). The US also sent troops to Honduras to protect US companies including United Fruit in 1903. And 1907. And 1911, 1912, 1919, and 1924......... and 1925
  
Then there's the ITT Corporation, who owned the telecommunications of Brasil. ITT feared the democratically elected João Goulart would bring about nationalization of this vital industry as a part of his land reform program - so the President of ITT Corporation, Harold Geneen, got his good buddy John McCone (director of CIA) to interfere. This would eventually lead to the 1964 Coup in Brasil and the installation of the military dictatorship of Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco. Fun Fact: John McCone would later work for ITT Corporation afterwards.  
  
ITT Corporation would then go on to finance opponents of the democratically elected (seeing a trend here?) socialist Allende government in the 1973 Chilean Coup, installing Pinochet. Another fun fact (this one is actually fun): The Revolutionary American socialist *Weather Underground* would bomb the ITT Corporation building in New York in retaliation.   
  
Of course you all know about BP and Iran. And the US funding of the psychopathic death squads in Nicaragua after the Nicaraguan Revolution gave rise to agrarian reform.     
  
Same story with Cuba - except the US failed.

So i've been trying to come to grips with being a good consumer while also having a lack of money/emotional capital. What have people found to be a useful way of dealing with this type of stuff? 

I.E. I need a smart phone for work and most smart phones are produced in a shit manner. Or, I have to buy groceries and dont have the funds to consistently buy more expensive less destructive brands. 

I make choices to do what my family can (we chose cloth diapering for environmental reasons, garden, bought a CSA last year, and try and buy products used instead of new)  BUT sometimes it just seems like damned if you do, damned if you dont...

-----==----==---==-----
Dont forget the government that killed hundreds of millions of people and enslaved entire populations.
-----==----==---==-----
Is there a website or something that lists some decent alternatives where I can get my products from?  I'd like to be a moral shopper, but sometimes I feel like everything I purchase is exploiting someone somewhere. Surely there's some decent corporations or businesses out there that I can support to minimalize this sort of thing. 
-----==----==---==-----
I'm sorry... but I'm just too addicted to Coke to give it up...
-----==----==---==-----
This just in - corporations do shitty things. Now here's Tom with the weather.
-----==----==---==-----
The end goal for me would be a society where everyone's basic needs were taken care of (healthcare, education, food, shelter, ect), where the use and allocation of resources is decided by communities based on what is good for the community (no more profit motive or shareholders to please), and where people are able to pursue their passions.

Oh and most importantly my socialist vision would be built around a global community that puts protecting the environment as its top priority. 
-----==----==---==-----
Socialism means 2 things to me:

The extension of democracy to every area of public life. I believe in what I call the sphere of influence. Simply put, this is a social order in which you have a say in everything that effects you, directly or indirectly. In practice this would look like a direct, limited democracy. Things like building power lines, laying internet cables or public works projects would be community decisions. Things like religious practices, drug use, or other lifestyle decisions would be personal. 

Workplaces would be run democratically by the people working there and participating in the production process. The household would be run democratically along the lines of the people who live there. Universities would be run by their faculties as well as their students. 


The second thing is the end of social alienation. if you are not familiar with the socialist concept of social alienation I recommend looking into it! But to put it simply again,  this would mean that we live in a society where we aren't consistently divided around arduous things like race, gender, nationality, etc. 


-----==----==---==-----
The objective definition is of course worker ownership of the means of production, but subjectively I also see ending capitalism and building socialism as imperative to building the "New Man" as Che talked about. This is a person finally and freely motivated to not act egoistically but with ethical interest in his fellow man and woman. Capitalism prevents such behavior.
-----==----==---==-----
*Communism as the positive transcendence of private property as human self-estrangement, and therefore as the real appropriation of the human essence by and for man; communism therefore as the complete return of man to himself as a social (i.e., human) being – a return accomplished consciously and embracing the entire wealth of previous development. This communism, as fully developed naturalism, equals humanism, and as fully developed humanism equals naturalism; it is the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man – the true resolution of the strife between existence and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation, between freedom and necessity, between the individual and the species. Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution.*

...But yeah, socialism strictly just means worker ownership of the means of production.
-----==----==---==-----
It means fighting oppression with a bit of nuance in there. Organize attacks but do not attack bystanders. Attack white supremacists and fascists if they stand in the way. Terrorize capitalists without terrorizing the people. And ultimately, emphasize solidarity and freedom.
-----==----==---==-----
And I wonder who will be paying for the damage...
-----==----==---==-----
Interesting piece. Much fairer than I anticipated considering the website it was on. 

However, I think that the writer has misunderstood Pete's positions and portrayed him as some sort of luddite, and a socialist who deviated greatly from leftist tradition.

To the average American reader, the line "… I like to think I’m about as much a communist as the average American Indian was…" must seem like an appeal to the noble savage, and a rejection of modernity.  However most readers on this sub are familiar with the Marxist understanding of humanity's development of productive forces, that posits that primitive communism preceded feudalism.  As a (former) member of the CPUSA I'm sure Seeger was also aware of that, giving that quote quite a different meaning. 

Secondly, the author writes "Seeger campaigned for civil rights, but he rejected culture wars and futile intergenerational battles". Seeger was described by the New York Times as “so far left politically he has probably never been called a liberal”. So it makes sense that he rejected culture wars and intergenerational battles. The essential contradiction in our world, according to Marxist framework, is class conflict. Class supercedes (but doesn't preclude the existence of) racial, generational, sexual and religious divide. Of course Seeger would reject identity politics and gerontophobia - this is true of any adherent to the principles of Marxist socialism. His particular brand of socialism is not particularly "conservative", unless conservative is read to mean orthodox. What is quite confusing is that the author doesn't fall into the traditional trap of considering the new left and the liberal agenda socialism - he quotes Marxist Eugene Genovese regarding the abandonment of socialism by the American left; "the irrational embrace by the Left of a liberal program of personal liberation”. However, he proceeds to ludicrous territory while trying to paint Seeger's pacifism and love of humanity as an essentially conservative ideal, co-opting Martin Luther King, Jr. along the way. Conservatism is an ideal that stands for preserving social institutions - reaction in Marxist terms. The social institutions of the past and present originated and sustained themselves through violence, coercion, and hate. Although I don't agree with the principles of pacifist resistance, I don't think the rejection of violence makes the belief less revolutionary or more conservative. If the author claims that Seeger's beliefs are conservative in nature, the same has to be said about every single appeal to love and comradeship in history; in this way Gandhi, Debs, and Che Guevara were conservative, while not one figure in history comes to mind as advocating the preservation of their corresponding mode of production and the associated social institutions based on a philosophy of loving all people regardless of colour, gender, race, sexual identity or class. I believe the author to be attempting to mislead the reader in this respect; he redefines conservatism to mean preservation of (assumed) pre-feudal values, yet fails to mention that such an understanding is entirely incompatible and contradictory to the current and long-time definition of conservatism.

Also, he paints Seeger as a luddite, wholly rejecting technology. "I honestly believe that if I'd been around when some person was inventing the wheel, I'd have said, "Don't, don't. Life may be nasty, short, and brutish . . . but you just can't know where technology is going to lead." However, reading the same interview from which that quote comes provides much better context than what the author insinuates. Although preferring to live in a more "natural" way, and being clearly wary of modern science, Seeger is mostly concerned about the impact of technology on the human race's ability to sustain itself. When Seeger's semi-rejection of "knowledge" is viewed through the clear context of environmental preservation and scientific ethics, it is much more in line with traditional socialist views; capitalism fails to provide the whole of humanity with the benefits of increased scientific knowledge, instead it is used to accelerate capitalist accumulation and suppress the working class. When the mode of production transitions to socialism, production and scientific advancement will take into account the needs of humanity as a whole, therefore protecting the environment from destruction and overuse, and eradicating the use and development of incredibly destructive technologies. As a socialist, read that statement and think whether or not you agree. I would venture to guess that Seeger's apprehension towards science is not a rare, conservative opinion but rather once again, fairly orthodox. 

Some excerpts from that interview: 

"However, I also have my own faith. I have a faith that, sooner or later, the Pope and all Catholics will realize that they have to allow some form of parenthood planning . . . Moslems will agree that women have the right to live as full human beings . . . and scientists will understand that there are some kinds of information toe[sic] dangerous to explore."

 There are, for instance, genetic ailments such as Huntington's disease . . . which killed Woody Guthrie and now threatens his son Arlo, as well as thousands of other people in this country. It's possible that work with the DNA molecule might help us find out what causes Huntington's disease and how to eliminate it. But unless that sort of investigation is handled very carefully, sooner or later dangerous information will get into the hands of a modern Adolf Hitler."

 "We may be terribly near to the brink of death, but we're also on the verge of some of the world's most thrilling discoveries."

"We need to reach the poor people who are thinking, "Gee, rich folks can afford to build a greenhouse and a passive solar home, but what can I do?" Well, the truth is that there's a hell of a lot more that such people can do . . . but most of them just haven't yet gotten the information."

They say it's a movement for 'democracy'. I don't know enough about it to say whether that's true. But I want to see if this experience has led the people of Ukraine to create new, communal, democratic institutions, or to simply take of new reigns in the old state. 

I keep hearing about the leader being deposed, I've heard a lot about protesters and police destroying shit. I haven't heard a single thing about anyone's plan going forward.

&gt;Hierarchy and scarcity: exterminism

&gt;Hence exterminism, as a description of this type of society. Such a genocidal telos may seem like an outlandish, comic book villain level of barbarism; perhaps it is unreasonable to think that a world scarred by the holocausts of the twentieth century could again sink to such depravity. Then again, the United States is already a country where a serious candidate for the Presidency revels in executing the innocent, while the sitting Commander in Chief casually orders the assassination of American citizens without even the pretense of due process, to widespread liberal applause.

I feel this is the most likely outcome.  Looking around at the trends which have become even more acute in the last decade.  The group of people excluded from productive work is growing fast, especially among the youth. We're confronting an ecological crises with in the next century which will certainly both accelerate technological development and scarcity.  

The latest [From Alpha to Omega](http://fromalpha2omega.podomatic.com/entry/2014-02-22T01_42_40-08_00) touches on this possibility of a future where there is a mass superfluous labor and the guest eludes to the potential horrors of this future in a capitalist state.  
-----==----==---==-----
The environmental damage we've already done is immense.

I hope it is Equality and scarcity. Not Hierarchy and scarcity.

This is ridiculous, since elected in 2010 they have worked as hard as possible to destroy the welfare state and privatise our national organisations (despite [public opinion](http://i.imgur.com/bkC2apL.jpg)). The party is run on the funds of [millionaires and corporations](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2013/07/12_partydonorsgraphic_x.jpg), 'workers party' my arse.

Tragically, this was done in Sweden a few years ago, and the conservatives have held power for almost eight year now, which has never happened before. It has been an INCREDIBLY successful strategy here, so don't underestimate it just because it sounds dumb.

I can't tell if this is a joke. Is this a joke?

This isn't surprising to me. Our ruling right-wing parties put out ads in their rags every May Day proclaiming to be the party of working people and how their policies have "helped" the working class. 

Of course, they don't mention that they're a party by, of and for the wealthy bourgeoisie with some ultra-nationalist side dressing. 
-----==----==---==-----
Nice doubletalk, reminds me of right to work (aka fire you because the whim hits us) in the states.

Tory's say they're the worker's party, Labour says they're the 'one nation' party. A classic switch.

But seriously this is just a bit laughable. The tories are in a dangerous position, they can see the country slipping away from them and a labour dominated century looks very likely. I'll bet we here them ramping up the anti-immigration rhetoric very soon, since that's the only issue they're likely to win working class support on.
-----==----==---==-----
Looking at their ideas for working-class people, it doesn't seem working-class friendly to me.

This is how the right works in America already. Combine it with appeals to racist and xenophobic sentiments and you'll have a juggernaut of Social Darwinism enshrined in a political power base that's nearly unshakable.

&gt; In a February 24 report about the agreement to the union's contract organizing committee, PAT officials said that they had forced the school board to concede on a number of fronts, including probably the most prominent demand of all--hiring additional teachers to allow for a meaningful reduction in class sizes.

&gt; The district has promised to add a "minimum" of 150 teachers--a significant victory given the district's prior refusal to even address the issue. Throughout bargaining, and until the last few days before the strike, officials had stuck with their offer of only 88 additional full-time employees (FTEs), claiming that the union's demand of 175 was "unreasonable."

...

&gt;SCHOOL OFFICIALS also agreed to pay raises of 2.3 percent in each of the next three years, retroactive to July 2013. This is a modest amount, but better than the pay freezes and pay cuts seen in many public-sector labor agreements. The proposed deal also mandates that the school district continue to pay 93 percent of health care costs.

&gt;The PAT also pushed back the district's effort to delete contract language covering teacher evaluations and the use of student test scores in evaluations. The proposed contract contains language that bars "the use of student performance on standardized tests as a basis for involuntary transfers, layoffs, placement on the salary schedule, and/or disciplinary language," union officials said.

"Socialism is the mass killing of anyone who speaks out against the government stealing everything.  It is worse than fascism".

I wish I was joking when I heard this person say that.  This is why you don't listen in to other people's conversations while travelling.

"Socialism/communism is where everybody owns everybody else's stuff. Someone could just come and live in your house or take your car or XBOX."

Even as silly as it seems to us this is actually an incredibly common perception (at least in the U.S.) and could account for a lot of reflexive hatred of socialism. It obviously stems from a misunderstanding of the difference between private PRODUCTIVE property and personal property. This is as much our fault for poorly explaining our beliefs to the uneducated masses. Though our enemies have much louder megaphones.
-----==----==---==-----
I had two history teachers at a community college and both were on opposite sides of the political spectrum. I never heard anything about socialism from the right-winger, but he kept making the point that the Civil War had "nothing to do with slavery" and that it was only about state's rights. Yeah, the state's right to enslave human beings.

In general, you aren't going to get accurate descriptions of socialism in the US. You either have right-wingers claiming that social security and medicaid is "socialism" or you have liberals saying that Norway is socialist because they have free college tuition. Honestly I'd rather talk to the misguided liberal than the insane conservative though. At least the liberal could be reasoned with and/or told what socialism actually is.
-----==----==---==-----
A "socialist" economy is a mix of laissez faire capitalism and communism. Examples include the Nordic countries and Germany. A "communist" economy is one where the state owns everything and there are no other businesses other than state owned enterprises. 

Why.

"Communism is a dictatorship."

I just looked over and said "No, communism means everything is in the public domain."

I grew up in Canada and the explanation was, the government takes from everyone and gives back to the people what they need.

Not as bad as this, but not entirely accurate either.

My coworker actually used this to explain liberalism a year or so back.  Being a liberal at the time, I explained that the liberal policy would be letting the kid with the A succeed, but keeping in mind how the kid with the C might have fewer opportunities, and making sure that kid has the opportunities to get an A.

Today, as a socialist, I think it's just a stupid metaphor.  Maybe a better way of explaining socialism is that there's no longer a teacher you have to work for to give the grade.  Instead the students get together in a democratic student's council and assign the grades, decide how many assignments they have to do, etc. But again, stupid metaphor.
-----==----==---==-----
Somewhat related: "Socialism will never work because eventually you'll run out of other people's money."   Urggghh

This is actually a pretty common meme that gets passed around in email chains / Facebook posts

http://www.snopes.com/college/exam/socialism.asp

I've seen it posted as true, then when called out as being a fabrication, whoever posted it responds with some crap about it not having to have actually happened to be true. 

Typical urban myth crap. 
-----==----==---==-----
My economics teacher explained that communism is a state controlled economy, a capitalist economy a purely private economy with no state intervention and that most nations are somewhere in the middle and that there are no pure capitalist countries, not even the US. I guess this is an understandable misconception since most countries that called themselves socialist/communist were largely state controlled economies.
-----==----==---==-----
The easiest way to explain socialism, is to take two students. One gets a grade of a 90, and the other student gets a 70. Then the first student tutors the second student so they both end up with 90. That's socialism.
-----==----==---==-----
It looks good on paper but.....
-----==----==---==-----
I hear this one a lot on Reddit (particularly /r/teens - I'm 18) 

Socialism is when you own two cows. The government takes both and gives you milk 

Capitalism is when you have two cows, you take some milk and sell the rest (sometimes included is buying more cows) 
-----==----==---==-----
Your brother wouldn't happen to go to Delgado in New Orleans, would he? Cause my American History teacher said almost the same thing to our class this morning.
-----==----==---==-----
Capitalism is where one student brings the paper and pencils for the other students, sits on his ass without contributing, and then takes credit for everyone else's work.
-----==----==---==-----
A socialist classroom would be the one where the students decide the curriculum and methods to ensure that everyone gets a 90.
-----==----==---==-----
One of my high-school history teachers gave the following demonstration:

First, he distributed a bunch of random objects (paperclips, erasers, my memory is hazy on it because it was several years ago) to the students.  Some students had a few more things than others, but it was nothing like the actual distribution of wealth under capitalism.  Then, he told everyone to start trading.  He said this was capitalism.

Then, he took everything away and then gave everyone in the class the same number of paperclips.  Then, he told everyone to start trading.  As could be expected, no one traded anything because there was no reason to do so.  This, he said, was communism.

I feel like I've linked [this article](http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/mar/11.htm) a million times, but seriously, liberals should read it.

The classroom analogy is an old trope that's terrible and completely misguided, yet incredibly popular.

Oh, I remember learning this in 9th grade but with communism. I don't think that's what my teacher actually believed cause he was probably the best teacher I'll ever have (and a total bro), but I chuckled at how ridiculous it was.

I'd file a formal complaint against his credentials.

Worst semi-accurate description:

"Everyone in the classroom helped to produce this overhead projector, therefore the overhead projector is owned by the classroom as a whole, not the owner of the overhead factory"

-Canadian Poli. Sci. Prof.

I have to say this left me more confused than I was before the lecture.
-----==----==---==-----
Just to state the bleeding obvious, a classroom is not an economy, and grades are not resources. I believe this is what is called a category error.
-----==----==---==-----
(Reads this quote from lecture slide) *The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.*

*Freeman and slave, patrician and plebian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.*

*In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.*

*The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.*

*Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other -- bourgeoisie and proletariat.*

**"So as we can see, Karl Marx wanted the state to expand and expand, taking over all the tasks until there was nothing left for business to do, so business would be phased out."**

This came from my public policy lecturer, who has a doctorate.

The worst explanation of what socialism is is the shite you get from stalinists when they try to make socialism into a thing different from communism, while at the same time making it the lowest stage of communism.  It's like trying to get someone to explain to you the holy trinity.  It's the worst people they distort what communism is, for long dead political aims, just because they have a boner for the soviet union.
-----==----==---==-----
That's amazing that the way American children understand socialism turns out to be the correct understanding.

I think that what is happening in Venezuela is that some right-wing business interests are seizing the opportunity that the current crisis is offering them and attempting to make a coup against the government.    

The crisis itself is a combination of Marduro's incompetency, and the power struggles happening between wealthy elites in the Chavista leadership.  The government elites have, to the detriment of the working class and poor in general, increasingly turned themselves into a bureaucratic monolith, with increasing levels of corruption and alienation from the grassroots communities that brought Huge Chavez to power in the first place. Marduro's government has the support of a large section of the Venezuela bourgeoisie, including insanely wealthy people like Lorenzo Mendoza, who he apparently recently met with.

I think that the government is increasingly corrupt and incompetent, but I don't think the solution is from the leadership of the current protesters.  This leadership is made up of the same people who ruled prior to Chavez, when things were far, far worse for the average Venezuelan.  What needs to happen is that the left-wing, grassroots elements of the Chavistas need to deepen their own power, take down corrupt bureaucrats, and move toward worker ownership of the means of production rather than government-bureaucratic ownership of the means of production.

Basically, I agree with [this article](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/02/is-venezuela-burning/).   
-----==----==---==-----
I don't contribute to reddit at all really, but I do use it a lot to find other sources other than mainstream media and news.  I think a lot of the issues arise of a major long social culture in the country.  I'm an US born Venezuelan, from 2 Venezuelan parents that left the country in the 80s during the presidency of a "right-wing conservative" president.  The issues then parallel the issues today.  Of course these are just my opinions, but after living there in 2008 for a year during the Chavez presidency, I concluded it's not the government, it's the people.  The government is a complete reflection of the people.  In this case, it might reflect that the "bolivarian revolution" represents the majority, which is the low income families and people, but let's not forget that it also reflects the mentality of constantly looking out for your best interests. Both groups are looking out for themselves, always looking over their shoulder of ,  professionally, economically,  for their safety, just almost ALL aspects of society there. 

It's not the government, it's the culture.  No matter who you put in power, someone is gonna get pushed to the bottom.  There will always be a polarity.  
-----==----==---==-----
Are you Venezuelan? What's your opinion of the situation?
-----==----==---==-----
For you to be able to have an argument that is in nature neutral so that you don't get one sided views and a lot of circle jerking you need to post it in a neutral subreddit. Posting on either a socialist sub or a democratic one would already have underlying connotations. That being said, some ideas from the government are not bad. Like most governments, be it socialism, democratic, or communist ideologically they all sound good, however the practice most of the time isn't. There was a post on tumblr about the Venezuelan government making it easier on women and having equality in the line of work and whatnot but, as I have it understood, those are privileges that would work on people that voted for the government. 

As well, one thing the opposition is protesting for is the insecurity, the lack of foods, the declining economy and so on, which the government does not help in making it better. I think that the Venezuelan government is very corrupted and the people are tired of seeing it be. 
-----==----==---==-----
Let me put it this way: If the execution/practice of Chavismo/21th Century Socialism was acceptable I myself would be Chavist right now.

The problem, IMHO, is not the Ideology, but the people who put the theory to practice, sadly the politicians that are on Venezuela's Government right now are corrupt, thieves and incompetent to say the least, and with this I'm not assuming the "opposition" side isn't like that too, however, It would be a fallacy to say: "Oh, the opposition leaders and politicians would be the same" when they haven't got a chance at ruling the Nation.

My philosophy is quite simple, I don't give a flying fuck about Ideologies, I care for the people being happy, if the politicians in charge are deemed worthless they NEED to be replaced and so on until someone who knows what he/she/they are doing turn up, if you can't agree to such a simple philosophy then, that would be quite contradictory, isn't the power to the people the objective of Democratic governments?

EDIT: See comment.
-----==----==---==-----
From the thread on /r/vzla 

Ok, let's have an adult argument for once.

Here are my premises:


* **This government doesn't know how to manage the situation**. The security is not guaranteed even in "normal" circumstances. There's no food and if there is, it's failing to distribute it according to what they preach (socialism). Same with medicines. Cancer-treating reactants.


* There are extremists on every edge (you could say both sides, but that's overly simplistic). Stupid people. Insane people.

* *Guarimbas*, just for the sake of burning shit are beyond stupidity. Nobody is going to give a fuck if you're closing your own street, perhaps your neighbours.


* There's no *coup d'etát*, those that are really thinking that because you yelled "y va a caer..." military forces are going to get up their fat cozy asses to help you, let me tell you, you are wrong.

* I'm with the oppositionists and I think the protest must be inclusive. If we don't consider the non-madurist chavista, we're losing every election again, and again, and again.

* The social discontent against this government is what is supposed to be growing, not the discontent towards oppostion because of some idiots burning a tire and putting up wires.

* *"But that's not the easy way, that's gonna take so long"*, just no.

* *"But Reinaldo dos Santos"*, just no.

* *"But my anonymous (guy fawkes) mask"*, no.

EDIT:

* I also think the US invading us is the most stupid thing that anyone can hope for. Nobody (*que tenga cuatro dedos de frente*) wants *los cascos azules* here. Is also really stateless/unpatriotic. But also is sucking on Cuba's balls just because you think *(honestly?)* that they've succeded with communism on their side. Again, **this is not an ideological crisis.**
-----==----==---==-----
&gt; try not to fill the arguments with logical fallacies, emotion, lack of facts etc

This accounts for literally like 98% of all we are hearing from the rich, right-wing Venezuelans over at r/vzla, so it's pretty hard to find "common ground" here.

That's all I'm going to say about that.

Hey all, not contributing to the discussion but I want to point out, there's been a lot written here, in fact 157+ comments. It's been a pleasure reading a lot of the comments from /r/socialism regulars and /r/vzla regulars. I'm glad government propaganda of CIA agents wasn't a central theme to anyone who had opposing views of Maduro's govt. I also didn't see any criticism of the Cuban society or govt here. I hope that most of you understand that Venezuelans, like any other humans in the world, have problems and goals that Socialism proposes to solve. Sadly, what has happened in Venezuela is weird and unique.

Anyway, thanks for your attention and keeping an eye on the situation in Venezuela. In the end we're all brothers and sisters, and Reddit is for looking out for each other, not a shouting match. Thanks to /u/contrejo27 for submiting the post.

Thanks /r/socialism for hosting the post, come by /r/vzla every once in a while.

Venezuela is in total shambles, and this is the fault of socialism. It was socialists who took over the country in 1999 and even since then, have run it into ruins. The economy is a fucking joke, crime is so rampant that just walking a couple of blocks from your house could be the last thing you do, food shortages, a common symptom of failing socialism, is the most serious in decades, and the middle class has been wreaked into oblivion. Yet you fucking socialists will STILL defend the country and act like it's going somewhere. Let me tell you something, and this is fact btw. South America is NOT THE PLACE TO BE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING DECENT. Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil are being influenced by cultural Marxism and radical social democracy, along with similar problems that Venezuela is facing right now. These nations are falling and will continue to fall for years until good conservatives can regain control of those countries. Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia are ruled by communism regimes. Opposition has been destroyed, private corporations have been collectivized by the government, the poor are even poorer, workers-cooperatives are allowing incompetent workers to try to be productive in society which brings down productivity, and much worse. I do not like libertarians nor am I in favor of libertarianism. The world runs off of social darwinistic principles, and it should be kept that way. Any country that has tried to reverse these principles ends up a wasteland. Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina will be just like Venezuela in the next few years. If you are reading this and are from each of the three countries, then LEAVE. Do it before it becomes too late, like it has for Venezuelans.

I believe in the abolition of the idea of "intellectual property" as well as the idea of copyright. In essence this is the legalization of piracy, however I certainly do not condone stealing from people.
-----==----==---==-----
If anything, file-sharing decriminalization seems to be more of a libertarian issue, unless you swallow the rhetoric about IP actually being a form of property ownership. 

Copyright isn't about letting people keep "their stuff", it's about the government granting people a monopoly over regulating other people's communication. 

Wanting it to be more minimal is not a matter of wanting to "*redistribute* IP" among the people, it's a matter of wanting people to freely communicate and the government out of your business and not make up such artificial regulations in the first place. 
-----==----==---==-----
I support abolishing intellectual property for the same reasons why I support abolishing private property. That being said, artists should be paid for the full value of their labor. I don't see this as being too big of an issue though. Most of us want to live in a world where there is music and art, I personally would want artists to be supported.
-----==----==---==-----
I want to just reply with "Intellectual Property is Theft", but like the original quote off of which that plays, it does require exploration, analysis, and thought to be more than just potentially problematic sloganeering. (It is, however, a use of the term with which I think even [Stallman](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html) would agree.)

The problem often stated about piracy is that it robs the artists of their livelihood and that copyright (and other IP regimes) are needed to make sure that these starving artists don't starve.

The problem with this formulation is that copyright is an incredibly poor mechanism for its stated goal.

Copyright places conditions of artificial scarcity on ideas, which (assuming sufficient storage and bandwidth that pirates readily contribute) have no scarcity whatsoever once initially disseminated. This impoverishes society culturally and, thanks to the exploitation intrinsic to the capitalist mode of production, doesn't sufficiently prevent artists' starvation.

I think the socialist response to this is that, rather than creating artificial scarcity, we should instead allocate democratically that which is scarce, have free distribution for that which is not and, with society's bountiful material surplus properly allocated and not wasted, make sure that starving artists (along with everyone else) don't starve.

But short of the revolutionary overthrow of private and intellectual property regimes, what are we to do? Is non-commercial copyright infringement to be seen as an act of civil disobedience? Is flocking to Free Software/Free Culture a prefigurationist retreat? Or should we use the abuses of intellectual property to agitate and organize towards a future socialist society without it?

Information, especially cultural information, has a fundamentally different quality than the physical objects our societies have developed their ideas about property rights to account for.  Both sides employ rhetoric based on these rights; the capitalists decry our attempt redistribute wealth away from the 'job-creators,' and we decry the capitalist exploiting his workers by extracting the excess value of their labor, which belongs to the worker by right.  Its easy to see the socialist line supporting intellectual property, after all, don't the workers who's labor produced a cultural work have the right to control how it is used and distributed and, if we are still operating in a market economy, monopolize profit making on it?

We have to remember that these ideas about property are social constructions, and although they are so deeply ingrained that they are a useful agitation tactic, we should not allow them to limit our thinking about the structuring of society.  Does our current system of ownership achieve the most possibly just, safe, and free society?  Is it relevant to the world as it wil be in the even near future?

Relevant question: the worker of the future walks into his garage, fires up his 3D printer, and prints himself a shovel.  Now, at the moment of creation, who owns that shovel?  Obviously its in the workers possession, but can it really be called the fruit of his own labor?  Do the workers who designed, built, distributed and supplied the 3D printer have a claim of ownership?  Since he owns what is, essentially, the means of production, has our worker joined the bourgeois?  The traditional socialist way of framing property rights is by use (land that you occupy or personally do agriculture on, things that you use in your every day live, tools that maximize the potential of your labor).  If our future worker prints two shovels, hangs one in the garage and never uses it again, and uses the other to dig trenches and provide for himself and family in the market economy, which does he own?  And what does that say about who owned the object just as it began to exist?

If our property structures are going to have trouble coping with even physical objects in the future, they have already hit that stumbling block when attempting to apply the model to information and cultural work.  Under current law, almost all of our cultural output that exists on a national scale is owned by studios or producers, essentially capitalists who employ workers and profit by extracting the excess value of their labor.  This is why I have never bought the argument that digital piracy is wrong because it hurts the workers who created something: If a worker stole bread from a major, wealthy capitalist, would he really be stealing from the bakery workers?  Furthermore, the actual benefits to the careers and labor value of the creative worker are dependent on the number of people who experience their work and the cultural conversation that work generates, not the money it generates for the capitalist.  So if you torrent a film, watch it, show it to your friends, talk about it and recommend it online, and post memes based on the main character on tumblr, who have you harmed or stolen from?  The creator has benefitted, as the viewership of his film has created a new fan who will enrich the cultural conversation about his work and who will be far more likely to voluntarily support him in the future.  The capitalist has been deprived of his socially granted right to control and profit off the film, but that's not a right anyone who calls themselves a socialist should recognize.  Labeling you viewing the film as theft is very problematic, and is largely a rhetorical tactic used by those trying to extract value from the film.  If you have 'stolen' a film, does the previous owner no longer possess it?  Do you really own a string of one's and zero's on your hard drive?  If use is our point of origin for property rights, is it really possible for anyone to 'use' that string of ones and zeroes in the way that concept of ownership was developed to cover?

So yes, I am against the legal ownership of our shared culture by capitalists, and do not think we should be punishing people only trying to participate in that culture.  The national and international artistic conversation is of vital importance to the workers of the world, and they should assert their rights over it.  Ultimately, that means allowing individuals to access and participate in it with absolutely no barriers, and supporting the creation of culture outside the capitalist model.  No good socialist should support one group of capitalists at the MPAA colluding with another at the ISP's to spy on workers, then colluding with the state to massively fine or imprison those who refused to give their tithe.  

tl;dr: Check the flair.

Aye, Matie! It is high time to repeal treaties regarding piracy on the high seas and time that governments of the world, once again, began issuing letters of marques. This will create jobs. Not only for privateers, but for the increased security needed on cargo ships! It will create more opportunity for the working class for advancement, all they need is to join a ship and work hard for their captain. Someday the crew might even mutiny and make them the captain! Further, the Pirate captains will expand the local economies of their homes. They will sell off their stolen goods and their crews will buy things in their hometowns, simulating the growth of a service industry that caters to the pirates!

What debate? That americans(who live in the richest nation in the world we are told all the time) who happen to be the most taxed people on this planet who get the least for it should not get a wage that insures them of paying taxes, their bills, ensuring  their independence as human beings? In a nation with the greatest inequality of rich vs everyone else we debate this injustice? Wages have stagnated for 40 years in the usa while production has skyrocketed.  










Profits have too mushroomed too, but  where do they go?  Do they  get shared with everyone?  Ah,not  to be shared with the workers but to the owners who now instead of investing back into the means of local production send their $ to offshore banks to avoid the taxes, so that you- the worker- has to cover those taxes and then the owners,since the 80's,  have been going overseas to take advantage of virtual slave labor, lax labor and environmental laws as they bribe the local corruptible politicians(as was done south of the usa for centuries-Read anything by Ernesto Guevara)...Now we allow ourselves to be deceived and duped by the very folks who are screwing all of us-the owners(Whom you know control our laws,our governments, our politicians). And this is the fault of people that they have to work shitty jobs for shitting wages that do not get paid as they should....?













Those are the same argument that the rich have been using since day 1. If we pay a viable wage we will all starve and we will have to close our  places of business. BS! If people are paid enough to live they will use their $ and Buy STuff!  That is the true strength of a viable economy; workers having $ enough to buy stuff...But they rich do not want you to understand that simple lesson of economics...We the people are the engine of the economy and if we don't buy, it slides downward .  How many pillows do the rich buy?  How many homes can one rich person own, 5, 10? How many can the workers who work in his plants own? If he has 300 workers that is 300 homes if he pays them a viable wage,right? This is not rocket science...Its simple economics...﻿

Well, I just briefly skimmed through your thing but I don't think I saw any talk on wages.  The point is that slavery arises out class society, where one group of people exploit, that is rest upon the labour of, another group of people.  Marx talks about this in Value, Price and Profit.  

" On the basis of the wages system even the unpaid labour seems to be paid labour. With the slave, on the contrary, even that part of his labour which is paid appears to be unpaid. Of course, in order to work the slave must live, and one part of his working day goes to replace the value of his own maintenance. But since no bargain is struck between him and his master, and no acts of selling and buying are going on between the two parties, all his labour seems to be given away for nothing.

Take, on the other hand, the peasant serf, such as he, I might say, until yesterday existed in the whole of East of Europe. This peasant worked, for example, three days for himself on his own field or the field allotted to him, and the three subsequent days he performed compulsory and gratuitous labour on the estate of his lord. Here, then, the paid and unpaid parts of labour were sensibly separated, separated in time and space; and our Liberals overflowed with moral indignation at the preposterous notion of making a man work for nothing."

While under the wages system "one part only of the workman's daily labour is paid, while the other part is unpaid, and while that unpaid or surplus labour constitutes exactly the fund out of which surplus value or profit is formed, it seems as if the aggregate labour was paid labour" and "[o]n the basis of the wages system even the unpaid labour seems to be paid labour".

There is also on top of this the compulsion of the capitalist mode of production where everyone has to obey the law of value.  This manifests itself from the fact that the products of labour are alienated from the direct producer, the proletariat.  This makes it seem as if the economy is something that is other than man made and a product of definite social relations.  The constant need for the capitalist to produce value, to turn a profit, compels them, regardless of how nice they are, to force down wages, increase the working day and/or increase productivity.
-----==----==---==-----
TIL I can't read a Zizek quote without using his voice.

I didn't see anything immediately objectionable in your essay, except that the way you wrote made it seem like you might not entirely understand the concept of class since you contrasted it a few times to social relations (which is essentially what class is).  I find it unlikely that you don't know this, but it might be worth rephrasing just to make sure your marker doesn't get confused.

On a style note, it's generally bad practice to include anecdotes or personal stories in an academic essay (at least in the institutions I've written them).  It can be difficult to think of at first, but there's always a way to phrase the same points without resorting to this.  Personally I tried to avoid using the word 'I' at all, though that's probably going to extremes.

For additions off the top of my head, you could consider noting that white collar workers rejecting their slavery isn't a new thing as the question implies.  John Reed talks about the telecommunications workers rejecting it in '10 days that shook the world', while a Bolshevik officer pleaded with them to recognise that they were workers like everyone else.

You could also consider discussing the theory of labour aristocracy, which points out that it isn't just white collar vs blue collar, but first world vs third world, which is what allows the relative affluence in the first place.

&gt;What level of being rich would you permit?

Ultimately socialism is the democratic rule of the working class. It's up to them which jobs are remunerated in what ways. There is no utopian formula for a pay scale. But think of this from my (Marxist) perspective. What possible work could you do in one hour that could produce $10,000? In reality that is impossible, however some in our society earn that much (or even more). Where does it come from then? Well it comes from unpaid labor of others. There is a class in our society which becomes very rich simply by owning and not by working. In a socialist society nobody could earn that much by owning, because production is owned and controlled by the community rather than individuals. Essentially there would be no maximum income, you could earn as much as you would like to work for.

&gt;How would you enforce this?

Socialist revolutions have involved the expropriation (or taking into social control) of the key levers of production. While for a while there will be small businesses and the like, the so called big capitalists will no longer own their MNCs, Fortune 500 companies, Finance Capital, Transportation etc. The resulting democratic structures would then be tasked with making sure some errant capitalist doesn't spring up (that would be impossible anyway due to the massive accumulation of capital which has occurred. Imagine how much money you would need to invest to compete with Apple in building computers. You could never match a socialist system's productivity by investing in your own capital).

&gt;I like the idea, for those willing, to live in a 'commune' type circumstance, but this entails those not born into it to chose to live in such a place. Would you want to force your system onto others, or establish a seperate network/society and alienate from all possible external sources?

That's not really how society works. I could give you various reasons from the theory of permanent revolution to historical materialism or whatever. Instead I'm going to lazily say I was never given the option of living in a racist capitalist imperialist system. And just to clarify a point, you seem to be under the impression that socialism means sharing EVERYTHING. There is a difference between private and personal property. We want to socialize production, that is the factories, the banks, or anything used to make things. Things you use to consume or satisfy a need are personal property. Socialists aren't interested in forcing you to let me use your toothbrush.

&gt;What amount of personal freedom should the average person have?

Don't be fooled by imbeciles on TV news who like to throw around the abstract term "freedom." The philosopher Hegel said something like abstract thoughts are for those who are incapable of really thinking. When we talk of "freedom" we have to ask, freedom for whom and to do what? The 13th amendment of the constitution of the United States is a curtailment of freedom. It claims that nobody is free to own slaves. However, we all know that this curtailment of the freedom of slaveowners means that our society is far freer because of the absence of slavery. In the USSR, of course there were limits to freedoms to move etc. However, people did have the freedom to live quite comfortably working 30 hours per week while having rent at less than 10% of income, free healthcare, free utilities, free college education, etc. So since the collapse of the USSR, the Russian people had been granted the freedom to travel, yes, and also the freedom to die of hunger, suffer in homelessness, wallow in joblessness, regain illiteracy, and deal with the Russian Orthodox Church. Now all socialists want essentially the maximum amount of personal freedom. But does that freedom allow for an individual in pursuit of profit work me for 60 hours per week for barely enough to survive? Where is my freedom then, if I'm spending half of my life suffering at the caprice of another individual? Now I think we can do better than the USSR did (allowing travel, free speech, etc) but we can also have those things they had. I would feel much freer in a society where everyone was guaranteed a job like in the USSR, and everyone who worked was paid at least a comfortable amount.  

&gt;I don't quite agree with the concept of social justice. I believe if I have been fortunate then I should do my best to help those who have not, but I'd rather encourage others to do the same than force them. I think requiring equal oppurtunity is fine, but this is tricky to enforce.

Affirmative action is a product of a racist, sexist class society. Now if our society provided quality jobs with decent pay and without discrimination for everyone (which is absolutely possible) then what need is there for any of that? If we have free, quality, public higher education and job training (again absolutely possible) then how can this issue you see even arise? Now I am one hundred percent on board with you that those people who can but refuse to work in our society should live on the work of others. Those fat lazy no good scoundrels who take my hard earned money and use it to live how they want without working should be required to get a job! So I agree that all of the capitalists who get rich off of our work should be made to work themselves and stop being coddled by the toilers of the world.

&gt;How can you garuntee within this system the eradication of 'pigs' on top of monopolies and governments?

No monopoly, no pig. If the production is operated democratically, then the workers who operate it are tasked with the duty of not allowing corruption (and corruption is generally a phenomenon of class society ie Haliburton paying millions of dollars to Dick Cheney). And without these classes, the state should fade away (without poverty, who is stealing?). And the basic ideas Lenin had are similar to what we would pursue.

*No public official to make more than a skilled worker.

*No standing army but the armed people.

*All public officials to be directly elected with the right of immediate recall.

*Constant rotation of all public offices. Every cook should be able to run the country.

&gt;Would many technological advancements have happened if certain obscene funding had not happened? Do you see this as good or bad?

Capitalism has advanced technology and production to unheard of levels. However, since about 1900, the system of capitalism has presented a fetter to advancement, not a boon. To state simply IBM in the 90's invested a lot of funding into microchips and made significant advancements. Then out of good will they shared their information. This caused them to nearly go bankrupt. So now 4 or 5 large electronics companies are all investing heavily to research the exact same things. This is idiotic and a socialist system could combine those resources in a far more efficient system. Also, there is a misconception in our society that it is the genius of capitalists which produces inventions and technological advancement, but that is not the case. The iPhone, for example, was invented by teams of engineers, computer scientists, etc who are all workers in our society. It's not the profit motive but their work which spurred development. It is actually profit which is preventing us from developing even better devices or proliferating these achievements across the world.

&gt;I do enjoy recreational activities I would deem selfish, but not irrationally expensive.

No one wants you to give up video games; we just think video game development should be funded by the community, managed by the designers, and freely distributed because it costs nothing to copy a game.

The type of language and questions you use here are not the sort of domain materialist Socialists are particularly interested in, it seems as if the subject you have in mind here is some sort of Left Liberal.

What I mean by this is when you use terms like "gluttony and arrogance" "permission of the rich" "social justice" and certainly "eradication of 'pigs'" even "monopolies", this is not the sort of ontology we deal with when approaching politics.

The question for Socialists begins and end with the systemic, look at the foundations of how society operations, the relations we see between each other without these sort of idealized constructs and reifications.

So lets sit back and look at what you're asking here which revolves around the question of inequality.

To begin with for Socialists we're not interested in simply the existence of inequality but how it comes about systemically, the way this functions in Capitalism is that the vast majority of the rich make their money through the ownership of productive property or Capital, this includes land, machinery and resources.

The reason for this is that the ownership of Capital gives the individuals who command it, and more of it the better, an advantage in earning profits created by production, the reason for this being that whenever a person is employed by a Capital holder (or Capitalist) it is because that person employed will always produce more profit for that Capitalist than it will cost to employ them, you don't get hired for 8$ an hour unless you are expected to make the company more than that back.

Following that economies of scale dictate that larger productive operations are more efficient than smaller ones, a firm which producing a shit ton of goods will be able to justify employing better machines, better managers, better engineers etc so one large firm has the capacity to outcompete smaller firms in a market eventually bankrupting or absorbing them.

The result is that the Capitalists who own these larger firms continue to accumulate more and more Capital.

Socialists therefore are not interested in classes as Liberals would understand them in the sense of being "rich" or "poor", but we look at people within the context of class by their relation to this productive process.

As was said those who make most of their money from the ownership of Capital are Capitalists (or in the classic term the Bourgeoisie) and those who make most of their money from serving Capitalists are the Workers (or Proletariat).

Socialists see this relation between classes as fundamentally problematic, the Capitalists only make their money through the ownership of property while the workers practically handle all of the work and organization in firms and yet the former retains the dictatorially right to decide how production is run, where it is run, who is running it and how the profits are spent with the working class simply having to accept this or be subject to force.

On top of this the Capitalists use their vast wealth and power to corrupt or form any political institutions to enforce their interests, to subjugate poorer nations of people and to put the well being of their workers and environment behind their short term profit.

Socialists then wish to end class relations, that is everyone should relate to the productive process in the same way with no one benefiting or suffering disproportionately, the way to do this is to be rid of private property, that is to say property should not be enforced as a rigid and unquestionable institution but should be restructured for the best interests of society.

Now this isn't to say some centralized bureaucratic entity comes in and takes everything and your house and clothes will no longer belong to you but rather when it comes to the vast holdings of the likes of Standard Oil, General Motors and Walmart and so forth, the factories, the resources the large stores all of these should not be controlled by whatever arbitrary small group of people hold a piece of paper saying they do but by all the communities they effect and rely on them.

That is why Socialism is the "Democratic control of the means of production by the working class", all those millions of people working in those organizations will get together and vote on what decisions there is to be made, to decide how the profits are spent, to decide how production is run and who should manage the firm.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;What level of being 'rich' would you permit?

There would be no person in authority to decide what is 'permitted'. When socialism becomes the naturalized mode of production people will technically be able to have enough wealth as they can create with their own energy. Without capitalist abnormalities (not freedoms) such as absentee ownership and state-enforced extraction of surplus value there is no possibility of becoming über-rich on the backs of others. In communism the whole concept of individual wealth would not exist, by which I mean that each individual would be as wealthy as the whole society, by which I do not mean that all wealth will be equally distributed, but that each individual will have access to the whole of all wealth.

&gt;How do you intend to inforce this?

I wouldn't. Socialism is the breaking of fetters. To free slaves is to absolve enforcement.

In communism, capitalism and markets become anachronistic and impossible. If you could just pluck an apple from a tree, there would be no reason for you to go to the market and buy one instead. If merchants would have a hard time, then how would capitalists fare? How are would-be capitalists going to pay private goons to enforce their arbitrary property rights if those goons don't need money in the first place? With the increasing development of the productive forces of society, scarcity will become more or less a thing of the past, meaning that communism becomes a possibility.

&gt;Would many technological advancements have happened if certain obscene funding had not happened?

I can not and would not wish the historical phase of capitalism away. An important point in Marxism is that the capitalist mode of production and its revolutionary capability to develop the forces of production has paved/is paving the way for communism. As for post-capitalist technological developments, we'll see what happens then.


-----==----==---==-----
&gt;Would many technological advancements have happened if certain obscene funding had not happened?

This is why I believe in "state socialism" as a first step. Mass organizations capable of resource pooling and coordinated efforts are necessary if we want to heal the disparity between first and third world, overcome the petroleum economy, and put a woman on Mars. 

In fact, a well-run socialist state is much better for technological advancement, since it can reward innovation without intellectual property. This means all human knowledge will be accessible by anyone. Of course scientists will still compete for prestige and funding, but their data will be freely available. Abolishing the system of monopolies on knowledge is only possible in a world were people who produce ideas don't have to worry about selling them for shelter and food. 

-----==----==---==-----
&gt;What level of being 'rich' would you permit?

If the income/wealth predominately (if not exclusively) comes from that person's own labour (and not from investments and what not), then however much that person can earn.

&gt;How do you intend to [e]nforce this?

State preventing enterprises that aren't worker cooperatives or credit unions from existing and making sure that people don't commit fraud and so on.

&gt;What amount of personal freedom should the average person have?

As long as the person isn't running a corporation (or similar enterprise) or physically harming someone, the person should have lots of freedom.

*Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism* by Richard Wolff is a good prescriptive work for socialism in the US. *Socialism: A Very Short Introduction* by Michael Newman is a decent choice if you're looking for a wider and more historical view of the socialist movement. *The Meaning of Marxism* by Paul D'Amato is also a good primer on Marxism.
-----==----==---==-----
Read [Socialism: Utopian and Scientific](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/) by Frederick Engels. It's a fantastic intro to the scientific historical basis of Marxism. It's also relatively short too! ~90 pages, but even less so if you don't read the mark(a short history of the German mode of production).
-----==----==---==-----
or if you want something more casual: www.panchorei.blogspot.com.  That's my blog, on it I explain socialism, what it is, and what it is not. I also give an example of what a socialist system might look like, and provide the text to some good socialist songs.

*Why Socialism?* by Albert Einstein. 
http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism


I also second *Democracy at Work* by Rick Wolff or anything from his website rdwolff.com. 
Such as: http://rdwolff.com/category/article-type/topical/op-ed


*Government in the Future* by Noam Chomsky, which is a talk you can listen to here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-Q4t-kJ2Q , or read here possibly http://tangibleinfo.blogspot.com/2006/11/noam-chomsky-lecture-from-1970-full.html . This will give a libertarian-socialist perspective. 


-----==----==---==-----
Sounds about right.  I always say, "Democrats are the best imperialists in the world."  Thing is, Republicans do overtly imperialist things like invade countries.  Democrats and liberals proceed to criticize.

Democrats, though, are not only a little sneakier (barely anybody commented on the drone strikes until a few months ago) but also can get away with it.  Liberals are scared that if they criticize too loudly, the "even worse" Republican will win the next election.  So liberals have to sit and try to justify the actions of Obama and other leading Democrats as corporate money pours into the Democratic campaign chest.  The illusion of a left Democratic Party preserves the legitimacy of American faux-democracy.
-----==----==---==-----
I think it's less Obama and more the system that he presides over. People often over estimate how much power and persuasion a single person can really have. Obama was never going to be as good as his supporters hoped because even if he were the 'ultimate democrat' he would still be operating within a broken system.
-----==----==---==-----
It is truly horrific to see liberals cheering on these protests as a struggle for democracy, completely unaware of the growing far-right elements.
-----==----==---==-----
The system of capitalism creates this dichotomy between wage work and housework.  Think about it: housework was once communal.  raising children was the responsibility of the entire community, the maintenance of the home was the responsibility of the entire community, the production of food was the responsibility of the entire community, the laundry was the responsibility of the entire community etc.  Think Colonial America.  That my friend is the answer to your problem: unionize housework.  
-----==----==---==-----
This gets everything so right.

The opposition is so bound to fail. The military is not on their side. They have, however, unfortunately succeeded in a media coup. Now there is foreign support for the internal claims of an illegitimate government and the mess that that support brings with it.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;8) If Nicolás Maduro resigns, will Venezuela return to its past state of affairs before Chávez?

&gt;No. First, in the case that should happen, it is impossible to turn back the achievements regarding progressive rights established by the Constitution and internationally backed. Second, it is impossible that, as some believe, the “opposition”—whatever we understand that to mean—will oust “chavismo” from “power”—in the broadest meaning of that term. The Bolivarian movement has a broad base that, regardless of how the protests end up, will continue figuring centrally in Venezuelan politics in the near and not so near future.

That is terrible, and idealistic. This is an entirely absurd piece.

It's high, but has been steadily dropping since the 90s. The highest point that the inflation rate has been since Chavez was first elected is still lower than the lowest point it was in the past two presidencies.

just so you know: Barack Obama and Tony Blair are in no way "left of center".  they are centrists, as in right smack dab in the center who are willing to listen to leftists on some issues.  That does not make them "left of center" that makes them good politicians.  
-----==----==---==-----
3:45 "they are demanding that maduro leaves office as soon as possible"

That's not what they are demanding. Please don't be another spreader of lies the current state of venezuela does not need this. The opposition leadership specifically stated that their demands are to release political prisoners, to put the killers of the protesters in prison, improved security specially in universities and now to let the opposition leadership speak in the Venezuelan media once.
-----==----==---==-----
It did, imperialists just murdered every leader and suppressed the shit out o every movement that attempted it. Patrice Lumamba, Kwame Nkrumah, Thomas Sankara, and so on.
-----==----==---==-----
I am not a socialist, but the theory goes that many of the leaders (such as Mugabe) claimed they were socialist a) to get Russian support and b) to gain their own people's support, as Capitalism was seen as Western.  

Also, looking at it from a Marxist perspective, Africa was highly underdeveloped.  Capitalism has only really existed there for a few decades- before that it was almost Feudalism during the colonial system, with land handed out by other governments.  So the idea is that much like in other countries, they were/are not 'ready'. 
-----==----==---==-----
They did. And after the USSR fell, when the cash flow stopped coming in, they gave up. 40 years of Soviet money gone to waste. 
-----==----==---==-----
I suggest [this](http://www.democracynow.org/2013/12/11/the_secret_history_of_how_cuba). Cuba had a huge role in attempting to encourage socialism in Angola and the Congo (now Central African Republic). Che Guevara helped organize a rebel army in the Congo. Cuban forces helped Angola to combat an imperialist apartheid invasion (backed by the US). South Africa at the time occupied the area that is now Namibia. That war in Angola was a typical Cold War proxy war - a conflict between two different factions that were separately supported by the US and USSR. 

As far as I know, Angola later struggled for decades in a very unfortunate and very bloody civil war between the Western backed factions and the communist faction. 

[Zanzibar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar_Revolution) also saw a revolutionary struggle in the 60s. Che had contact with rebels there in his time in Africa.

Another area of considerable socialist struggle in Africa is Algeria. I'm really not that well informed on this, but I know that the [FLN party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_%28Algeria%29), which was chiefly responsible for spearheading the fight against French colonialism, is a socialist organization. I don't know if they still exist as a true socialist organization today or if they are currently active, but in the 60s and 70s they showed solidarity with members of the Black Panther movement and other radical leftists like Carlos the Jackal. The film "Battle of Algiers" is always a good starting point for this. 

EDIT: Just a reminder to OP: /r/communism101 is great for this kind of stuff. 
-----==----==---==-----
1: religion.  socialism is viewed with suspicion there, because religion is so influential in many African nations.   
2: socialism is a European ideology.  one of the pitfalls of traditional Marxist-Leninist thought is that it is universalist: i.e. it assumes that culture is irrelevant, this is not the case.  
3: look beyond labels.  There are African movements which could be characterized as "socialist" but which did not themselves use that word: because this is a word associated with political parties in colonizing countries, which often have not acted in a properly socialist manner towards the colonized peoples.  The word means something different in many parts of Africa, but that does not mean that the ideology is not there.  
-----==----==---==-----
It did. The result is called **Somalia**. 

Edit: or Zimbabwe.

Some of those cities with the lowest inequality are not the most progressive places.

But then again, the state with the lowest income inequality is not very progressive either.
-----==----==---==-----
In some cities, as the article readily admits, the inequality is simply invisible because it lies outside the city.  In places where the poorest people live in the rural areas or in another city entirely the income inequality may appear to be less, but it is actually more.  The New York Metro Area probably has the highest gap (0-multibillionaire), but The New York Metro Area is represented here as two separate cities in different states (New York, NY and Trenton, NJ).  It's misleading, you can't just look at the cities, you've got to look at these things regionally. 
-----==----==---==-----
You couldn't just say "some cities are created equal"?

And yet in other interviews with sociologists he explicitly calls himself a Marxist and a socialist. This man is simply an opportunist tool who panders to his audiences.

He's absolutely right. The change which comes from political institutions are only temporary rearrangements of the external pressures to manipulate people through fear into expressing themselves and being in ways they don't want to be. In order to truly change into who you want it has to come from you.

no one is disputing that.  individual enterprise must nor originate from government or the UN. That is why it is called "individual enterprise".  Even Marx wouldn't dispute that, and he wouldn't even necessarily say that people shouldn't conduct individual enterprises.  Marx was all about small-time producers.  What Marx had a problem with was people who did not produce, but who got the benefits of production.  Leninism, the type of communism seen in the Soviet Union, was only one among many methods for implementing Marx's vision.  "communism"is simply the idea that those who produce should be the beneficiaries of production, how that gets accomplished is immaterial.

The form of law which I propose would be as follows: In a state which is desirous of being saved from the greatest of all plagues—not faction, but rather distraction—there should exist among the citizens neither extreme poverty nor, again, excessive wealth, for both are productive of great evil . . . Now the legislator should determine what is to be the limit of poverty or of wealth.”

This is great stuff, but it's a little more complicated than the metric shoes. In Chicago the rich and poor are both within city limits, hence the high inequality. However, metropolitan Milwaukee, near where I grew up is as bad, but the rich mostly live just outside the city limits (Ozaukie, Elm brook, Brookfield, Wauwatosa) while all the poor and working class stayed within the city limits. Rich and poor live just as closely in Milwaukee and Chicago, but because of the arbitrary nature of city boundaries and historical accident, Milwaukee appears less unequal. That is not to say Chicago isn't trying to force the poor out.
-----==----==---==-----
Miami, Fl resident here. Yes, there is an unimaginable amount of inequality in this city. I know this will just be another completely anecdotal post here but I have seen some pretty outright abject poverty just a few blocks from luxury condos. A street that is lined with homeless people basically in the shadows of a luxury condo that stayed empty after the economy went into recession and nobody went for it. There is a reason [they started living in one under similar circumstances in Venezuela](http://nymag.com/homedesign/urbanliving/2011/caracas/)...

There are continuous outright attacks on poor and working folks. City commissioners are often caught stealing tax money and in a few infamous cases from the money was supposed to be for affordable housing projects. The richest zip code in the whole state (I believe) is less than 3 miles away from the poorest one in the county (at least). 

edit.. formatting..
-----==----==---==-----
No, we don't take to the streets anymore: you know why? because you get sprayed with fire hoses and beaten with sticks, but it doesn't do any good. Instead we organize and we vote, we start with the small things then work our way up to the big things.  Our national association of psychologists put out a statement that any psychologist who did work at Guantanamo Bay would no longer be welcome at their conferences, and might have trouble finding a job (hint hint) should they need to look for one.  We elected a socialist party to the Seattle legislature.  We are fighting the Keystone XL pipeline, and also an anti-gay bill in Kentucky.  We're helping our comrades heat their houses across the Northeast and Midwest.  We're experimenting with a single-payer health care system in Vermont.  These are not glamourous things, they are not flashy and they do not involve a lot of flag-waving.  But they are important.  No, you don't see lots of marchers out in the cold with fists raised and red flags waving: because that doesn't actually do anything.  It gets attention, but attention is the last thing we need right now.  Because attention brings persecution.  The longer we remain invisible, the easier it will be for us to do the things we want to do.  As long as the right-wing nutcases are busy denouncing the neo-liberals, the better things are for us. We cannot survive another McCarthy, so shhh...

this article makes no mention of corporatism: which is a shameless ideology which though exploitative, is less cruel than some others.  For those unaware, corporatism or "smiling fascism" as it is sometimes called, is a sort of "bread and circuses" ideology.  The state offers benefits, in exchange for being allowed to exploit the labor of it's citizens unchecked.  The world leader most closely associated with this ideology is Perón in Argentina, and it is still a popular ideology in Latin America. However, as you can see it is an old and widespread ideology, and one that doesn't look all that different from pure Marxist-Leninist brands of communism (indeed, corporatists have often gone under the name of communists, or socialists).   It's basically fascism without the eugenic component, or Stalinism without the gulags, or you might think of it as "gangster politics".  Everyone is provided for: provided everyone is in the system.  But it's very clear where the power lies, and it is not with the people.

As an Amazon employee myself, this is all eerily familiar to me.

To be exact, I'm what Amazon calls an "ambassador," which is really a job trainer. I greet new groups of temporary workers, give them a tour of the warehouse, take them through a safety training course, and then finally teach them how to do the job they're assigned to do.

Recently, we had our "peak," which is Amazon's term for the busiest time of the year. To tackle the peak, hundreds, maybe even thousands, of temps were hired all at once. Warehouses were overcrowded. You had to show up about half-an-hour before the shift started if you wanted any hope of grabbing a parking spot, otherwise you'd need to park somewhere else and catch a ride on an Amazon-owned bus. You had fifteen minutes to do so, otherwise you were penalized. On many days, select people were sent home without pay so that the remainder would have work left to do. Talk about the contradictions of capital.

So what happened to all those temp workers once peak was over? They were fired just as quickly as they were hired. Entire groups of temps were shuffled into a room and told they were being put on a "waiting list" until they were needed again, which wouldn't be for another month or two. It wasn't unusual to see people walking out in tears. Out of those hundreds that were put to work in my warehouse, I think maybe ten to twenty remained after it was all said and done.

So yes, Amazon sucks.
-----==----==---==-----
I just want to buy shit from someone that isn't evil. Fuck this.
-----==----==---==-----
Amazon as a co-op would be a truly amazing thing! This massive marketplace that sells million of items, under the control of its workers for the good of society. If I were to have a committee that transforms companies into co-ops this would be the first one to go!

All the while in the big scheme of things, to paraphrase Kropotkin, what benefits us more as a whole (species) in the struggle for existence : unabashed competition or mutual aid and cooperation?

Just because subjugation and exploitation has been a mainstay of civilization, alongside social-Darwinism, doesn't mean there's no alternative?  An economy geared towards consumption, putting a stop to the separation of labor, as well as respect of workers conditions/safety/well-being as foremost values... an horizontal alternative is possible, workers truly possessing the means of production logically entails an end to exploitation as we know it.

It a false equivalency to say without exploitation, nobody would do the hard, shitty work.

Think of the olden days more aligned with agrarian models, with communal land, something like collective work including logging/woodcutting before winter was approached and considered like a festival of sorts where everybody that could carried there own weight, everybody rejoicing from the bounty whether kindling wood or vegetable harvest.

Hard labor when done cooperatively for a collective gain is perceived differently, when not forced under subjugation, it's a source of pride, encourages those willing and able to take part, also importantly out of fear of being considered a mooch, there's added pressure to take part, thus spreading the workload in a more egalitarian fashion.

If we also take the forceful factor out of the equation when it comes to exploitation of labor, there will still be incredible accomplishments like architectural and artistic marvels under workers guilds during the middle ages, but those undertakings will be striven for from the bottom up, not fueled by the capricious desires of rulers.  Truly catering to the peoples needs will still require extremely hard work, but "muh roads" will still be built, natural resources will be extracted, plumbing fixed and garbage picked up, even under full communism, even with added free association at it's utmost. Selflessness and sacrifice is contagious in a context where everybody contributes to their hearts desire and is rewarded simply by self-value of worth while contributing.

A day will come when miners and fishermen/women will be our true heroes and away will wither the cult of personality of the privileged.

A little more background... Mercosur, representing Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay unanimously released a statement ["condemning the destabilization attempts against the government of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro."](http://en.mercopress.com/2014/02/17/mercosur-condemns-violence-in-venezuela-and-calls-for-dialogue)

Today, the president of Argentina backed up Bolivia's position and [expressed solidarity](http://en.mercopress.com/2014/02/22/cristina-fernandez-ratifies-solidarity-with-venezuela-opposition-should-wait-for-next-elections) with the Venezuelan government. 

[Democracy Now had a good report on the US/ Venezuela situation](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/2/20/venezuelan_protests_another_attempt_by_us) the other day.


If you don't know, the US government has spent [hundreds of millions of dollars trying to overthrow](http://lap.sagepub.com/content/40/3/207.full) the Chavez/Maduro government. 

Greg Palast made a documentary about it. [Here's the link.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qmcUIOLrsI)

That's because it's a philosophy encyclopedia. If you look in political philosophy encyclopedias, they have all those things. 
-----==----==---==-----
They have Anarchism, Communism, Marx, Socialism; just not necessarily under those headings. Trust me I use stanford encyclopedia all the time in my degree.  
-----==----==---==-----
They have [Marx](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/).
-----==----==---==-----
Mixing left-libertarianism with right-libertarianism in the same article for an encyclopedia is a dumb idea. This is why you get such silly conclusions like at the bottom of the article which only apply to the right variant and not the left. The first and whole point of the left-libertarian tradition is to meet human needs and promote equality unlike the right variant.
-----==----==---==-----
There are a few more specific articles, but yeah, no general one. In addition to those on specific people (Marx, Baudrillard, Sartre, Marcuse, etc.), there's one on a specific topic, [Feminist Perspectives on Class and Work](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-class/).

There'a also a "criticism of markets" section in the kind of weirdly general article on [Markets](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/markets/). Plus some relevant content in the articles on [Egalitarianism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/), [Exploitation](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/exploitation/), and [Négritude](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/negritude/).
-----==----==---==-----
These articles are written by academics who know about the subject and present them here. It just means that no left libertarian, or socialist of any kind, has taken the time to write up the subject. 

There's plenty of critical theory stuff here. Kropotkin is mentioned occasionally. Deep earth ecology as well. 

I think it's more of a matter of disorganization rather than intentional neglect of a subject. You'd be surprised how many subjects you would think should be there aren't (e.g., good luck finding something that explains humanism, structuralism, or foundationalism in any of their forms).

/r/worldnews is highly right-wing. I wonder if any of those people know that even TIME reported today that the pro-government protests are larger than the anti-government protests.
-----==----==---==-----
OP, you need to stop listening to bourgeois media. They aren't reliable news sources.

The core of these "protesters" are fascists, who have formed a paramilitary with thousands of stolen weapons, and who seek a coup. You're as bad as the liberals if you're supporting the protesters just because the government is a travesty. 

This ridiculous mentality of picking a side needs to stop. It's one of the reasons I joined the party I did - boiling every issues down to goodies and baddies is over-simplistic analysis at best, downright damaging to the working class at worst. 

Ukrainians need to build a democratic workers resistance to both the fascists and the government. 
-----==----==---==-----
Russian imperialism is losing out to European imperialism. I don't see how this can be considered either a victory or a loss for the people of Ukraine. I'd hazard saying that the EU is preferable to Russia, but when the pro-European fighters are also fascists that's a huge blow.

http://www.democracynow.org/2014/2/20/venezuelan_protests_another_attempt_by_us

&gt;And I think there’s a tendency—there’s an unfortunate tendency, if you follow Twitter or if you’re on the Internet, that, you know, in this sort of post-Occupy moment and in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, every time we see—every time we see protesters in the streets, we start retweeting it, and we start to sort of, you know, feel sympathetic, without necessarily knowing what the back story is.

-----==----==---==-----
The English speaking mainstream press (The guardian, NYTimes, CNN, BBC, etc) has used the pursuit of freedom as the main message to inform about the situation in Venezuela covering only one side of the story. The message from the media also has been very sentimental and simplistic, focusing on peaceful students demonstrating because of the shortage of food and toilet paper and insecurity, but they don't cover all the violence and damage students has done in the street on behalf of their cause or the complicated reasons behind the shortage of food and toilet paper. The media also covers very little the most recent work done by opposition leaders (since November 2013) to organize students in main Vzlan universities to support their cause #TheExit, and the trips opposition leader did to Tachira early this year, where the first student demonstration started. The media doesnt mention too often that the Venezuelan constitution states that the only constitutional exit is a referendum in 2016. Finally, there has been exaggerated claims of censorship in Vzla and lack of internet access in the country. However, the mainstream Vzlan papers(el universal, el nacional, el diaro de carcas, el mundo, ultimas noticias) has been covering the opposition site in daily basis, and opposition supporters have used social networks as the main way of communication. 
-----==----==---==-----
I think you have to be wary about making this claim:

* the protests began after students from *Universidad Nacional Experimental del Táchira* were imprisoned for protesting against police sexual assaults and increasing violence

* solidarity took place in various other universities the next day, protests at which more demonstrators were arrested

* *"The wave of indignation had as context the economic crisis, the shortage of first necessity items and the crisis of basic public services, as well as the beginnings of the imposition of new economic austerity measures by President Nicolás Maduro."*

* it is true the main opposition leaders **are anti-democratic**, but they only attempted to capitalise on already existent protests

* as usual, the government violently suppressed these rising protests which only fueled and fuels more anger and protests -  In Caracas, three people were murdered during the protests, and the government funded newspaper Últimas Noticias itself countered government claims by revealed government troops as culpable

* the government has threatened with sanctions radio stations and newspapers that transmit information about protests

* The number has surpassed 400, and they have suffered torture, including reports of sexual assault, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. 5 people have been murdered.

* it's worth noting that unlike the US-backed coup attempt in 2002, the chavista movement and its popular base has yet to support the government either in words or in the street. 

* the protesters aren't about a single thing or follow a single ideology, but consist of different people, in different places, arguing for different things. Some are concerned about political freedoms (generally the students and middle-class) other protests against inflation, scarcity and lack of proper public services (generally the poor and working-class sections)

The government has simply stated this is another coup, whilst providing little or no evidence as such. It uses to coup to quell dissent and garner the support of the left, any opposition, even by workers who want a better condition of existence can, as such, be simply cast off as US backed imperialists, their demands ignored, their actions crushed. 

*"But while the international left-wing continues to turn its back and support — without any criticism — the government’s version of “a coup”, it leaves thousands of protesters at the mercy of the most conservative discourse of the opposition parties, without any reference to anti-capitalists, revolutionaries and true social change that could influence them."*

People are suggestible machines which take too much for granted. What were you expecting, with the amount of media control in the west?

&gt;I really wish people would stop making memes and such which only make this misinformation spread faster and faster.

Isn't that what this post is? As an outsider who's been sympathetic to the popular movement backing Chavez, I find it hard to form any opinion right now because of all the blanket statements and name calling on both sides.

I'm not going to accept that these protests are anti-democratic just because someone tells me they are.

I haven't followed the news that closely, but I was tending toward sympathy for these protesters when I saw what appeared to be security forces firing on unarmed civilians.

I don't need to be convinced that the US supports the political opposition in Venezuela or that some of these groups are using unethical tactics to encourage the protests, but I'm skeptical when I see people label all these protests as anti-democratic or fascist.

Based on the rhetoric and things I've read so far, I'm beginning to think I won't reach a conclusion any time soon.

Edit: forgot a word

Because the media are massive multinational corporations. Multinational corporations don't like the Venezuelan government. Therefore the media makes up all sort of stuff about the government.

See the [Propaganda Model by Hermann and Chomsky.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AnB8MuQ6DU)
-----==----==---==-----
The protest are democratic.

**The riots** are the anti democratic ones, burning people's cars, state's buildings, stealing and killing .


World powers who dont want to **Pay** for their oil, build this Propaganda and makes sure to call them both "protests" and even blame the government for the rioter's crimes.

Worth mentioning...... A small minority of riot police behaved like thugs during riots and used their guns. The president has already turn them in to face justice and has asked the judicial system to put them in jail.


-----==----==---==-----
The government has shut down the internet. The government is acting in a anti-democratic way.

protests arent anti democratic, people demanding a change of policies due to crisis should be totally expected.

Everytime a Westerner sees a bunch of brown people in the streets of a country that we've been told to view as evil, they assume it's a good thing or some kind of revolt against tyranny.

I think that's too simplistic. Some of the people behind the protests have a history not respecting the democratic process, that is, participating in the abortive coup of 2002 but that's not something that can be said of everyone protesting.
-----==----==---==-----
Where can I find a good explanation of what's really happening? I'm very confused.
-----==----==---==-----
A country that has shut off the internet is not worth protesting?
-----==----==---==-----
I am genuinely curious though. Communists advocate a violent overthrow of the state (so do I, to make things clear), so why are so many so quick to decry the anti-democratic character of those protests?
-----==----==---==-----
The Chavista movement is neither under workers' control itself, and nor is it enacting workers' control in society.

Even where it is nationalising businesses, it is not consistently placing them under seriously democratic workers' control - and without that, nationalisation is just exchanging one set of bosses for another. And it hasn't just opposed workers in specific trade union struggles, but it opposes and undermines trade union democracy and the right and ability of trade unions to stand independent of the state and of the PSUV (and does so wielding the power of the state against workers' organisations!). As far as I have read, the level of democracy inside the PSUV is pretty abysmal too. And it is a party which, in government, cooperates extensively with significant sections of the capitalist class to protect their interests, including at times against the interests of workers, and has been reliant in turn on the support of capitalists. A socialist movement can be imperfect, it can mess up, it can have bad tendencies inside it, but it's really pushing it to suggest, as this movement does, that serving, collaborating with, and relying on the capitalist class is part of some path to socialism. These are basic principles, not dogmatism.

It's perfectly possible to oppose the right, and even defend against the threat of it toppling chavismo, while also opposing chavismo from the left, and saying that if socialism is achievable it has to be founded in the independent power of democratically organised workers.

At multiple points its overall policy has been to oppose and attack workers' struggles - sacking workers who organise, condemning strikers, and supporting repressive measures, even threatening to use the military to intervene in industrial struggles, including against those working for international private sector businesses like Mitsubishi. I certainly don't see how this "revolution" is remotely under the control of workers beyond the level of parliamentary democracy of most capitalist countries.

Really it looks like the chavista regime is just managing capitalism in a substantially more left-wing way than its predecessors. We should oppose right-wing lies and reactionary coups against it, but that doesn't mean the left should be apologists for it.

In Thailand this is completely true. The protesters there are all beneficiaries of the traditional elite, the so called middle class and moneyed interests. They despise democracy because they've lost every election since the 2001 General Election, which catapulted Thaksin into power and the last time a Democrat, Abhisit, got into power, it was through a military coup. They want to abolish the popularly elected parliament and replace it with an undemocratic, unelected "people's council" (Ha!). They're little more than fascists and absolute monarchists and the sooner they realize that they won't win unless they actually try to get votes from working class people outside of Bangkok and supporting democracy, the better.

I find it odd how few Americans even know about toiletry mythology spun out of the original Red Scare.  Just as many people are too dim to imagine anything could possibly work better than unregulated free market commerce, it seems many cannot imagine what it would be like to inhabit a community where purpose-made toilet paper was an oddity.  Fear of the Soviet Union was stimulated by tales of toilet paper "shortages" in places where toilet paper was never really a thing to begin with.  It seems similar tricks are in play in this propaganda struggle.  If free market economics is so wonderful, why the need to deceive so aggressively in the effort to rally support for a market-oriented social movement?

Honestly, Venezuela is corrupt as all hell.  I know [one of the guys that is incredibly rich off of Venezuelan corruption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derwick_Associates).  This company had no experience building anything, no experienced employees, and got a $5B (US) contract for $3B worth of power plants.  Venezuela's corruption is BAD.  Socialist government with crony capitalists in the background.  It's a joke, really.    

Venezuela is a mess- the lack of free press, the government's control over industry, lack of goods and high inflation , and young men in their 30's with exclusive contracts making BILLIONS of DOLLARS (US)- it's similar to the development of the Russian oligarchs- it's just dirty money going to a few, while the Venezuelan government professes "a people's movement." 


-----==----==---==-----
Great, now show what the streets look like... oh wait, you don't want to do that because that will show just how bad Venezuela is right now.

I'd vote if I had something worth voting for, but there isn't an option, so I don't bother.
-----==----==---==-----
No, I don't vote. It makes no difference.
-----==----==---==-----
While I do not believe elections will be what brings about true change, I still plan on doing so this year and in the future. As long as I live here, I might as well take advantage of the "freedoms" I am provided.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm an American, and I do vote. Many times, I know my vote will not make a difference -- I live in a heavily republican congressional district in a traditionally democratic state -- so it's often very clear that regardless of how I vote, a particular candidate is going to win. In those instances, I cast my vote to make a rhetorical point. In local elections, I don't believe I've ever seen a socialist candidate, but I vote for the person I believe will do the best for my city, because that's often not pre-decided.

Voting isn't enough by a long shot, but from what I see, it can't hurt and might be of some small help.
-----==----==---==-----
It depends. I think some elections are worth voting for more than others, but I know that voting at all will draw *heavy* criticism from lots of people here. For example, I plan on voting in my state's gubernatorial election this Fall. The incumbent is a Democrat who is highly vulnerable, and the opposition is all tea party Republicans who I think will quite literally destroy what is left of this state if any of them get into power. It's going to be really close unless the tea party moron really messes up before November. Therefore, I think it's in my best interests to vote for the Democrat in this particular election.

I enjoy following elections as a hobby because I find it all really interesting, and right now I'm just sort of biding my time for a socialist party to get the momentum necessary to start running candidates I can vote for.
-----==----==---==-----
I live in Malaysia and we've been ruled by a coalition of right wing parties since independence in 1957 and the only time they've ever lost the popular vote was the last election in 2013. I've not yet reached voting age (Which is 21 here) but I'll register as a voter soon. 

The revolutionary options here are nonexistent. There is exactly one socialist party, the Malaysian Socialist Party and I'll probably vote for them in the next general election if they field a candidate in my constituency. 
-----==----==---==-----
I vote my conscience here in the United States. Which has meant hopeless third parties, unfortunately.
-----==----==---==-----
I mostly vote at a state level
-----==----==---==-----
While I think revolution is the only force that will make any huge and lasting social Change in the world, I still vote, to make the Marxist message more widely heard and understood and influential. I live in France, and I have seen more people in recent years drift to the left wing, probably in reaction to the capitalist crisis of the euro zone, but there are also many emerging fascist elements. Especially with the rise of Front National support. I don't want anyone in Europe to make that same mistake twice with fascism. 

Our Communist Party is stronger than most nations, but much weaker than it used to be (used to be the majority in parliament after WW2). I usually vote for them, Worker Struggle, a Leninist-Trotskyist group, and the Left Front, which is comparable to the Greek SYRIZA, also includes the communist party.

I don't know many more than you about the current situation in Venezuela but I think this is a good reminder to whomever wants to have a wider view of the context : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_coup_attempt_(Venezuela) 
-----==----==---==-----
Alright, first let's examine what is a coup. A coup d'état is usually a sudden deposition (ousting) of a segment or the immediate leaders of a government, usually with the aid of the military. So if you look at the coup attempt in 2002, in less than 48 hours Chávez was deposed, the opposition led by Carmona assumed power, collapsed, and Chávez was restored to power. Coups progress quickly once in action (although in 2002 the opposition built unrest with strikes and made plans to use snipers to incite support for the opposition and against Chávez).

Knowing what a coup is, that isn't what is currently going on in Venezuela. Given the negative, undemocratic connotations of the word and what happened in 2002, people are using that word when it doesn't really apply (yet). The opposition is trying to do a few things at the moment: destabilize the current government, build local and international support, create an aura of legitimacy. Could this be building up momentum for a coup or revolution? Yes, it's possible, but given that the opposition hasn't been cohesive enough in the past to pull it off, I'm not sure they have the resources to be successful if they were to even try.

In any case, it's hard to know what's really going on in Venezuela without being there. There are protests and demonstrations, but i wouldn't call it a revolution either. The opposition says that the government controls the media, but the opposition is going to be biased for obvious reasons, as well as major (American) news outlets who love to jump on the "socialization is fascism" bandwagon/media circus. South American politics are not my field of study, so I'm pretty skeptical of everything going on at the moment. I'm certainly not too supportive of the opposition (especially given their history of staging/falsifying events to win sympathy). It seems Venezuelans on reddit at least, even those who have complaints against the current government, do not seem pro-opposition either or supportive of the opposition's main goals. Without all the facts, it's unclear whether the current unrest is indicative of popular Venezuelan opinion, or concentrated in Venezuelan's disgruntled upper class.
-----==----==---==-----
Maduro is the legitimate leader, his party won two elections last year. The elections were monitored and the ballots audited, there is reasonable certainty it was a fair election. Regardless of the grievances of the protesters, they have no basis to demand that the government or Maduro step down. 

Imagine if the Tea Party took to the streets after the 2012 elections and the Republican Party then demanded Obama resign because "look, the people don't want him in power!" No one in the US would stand for that, you can't just overturn the results of democratic institutions because you don't like the results. 
-----==----==---==-----
Among other things, Occupy had no real goals that were visible to anyone outside of the protests.
-----==----==---==-----

I'm a microbioloist with an extensive background in climatology, and I really hate this writer's tendency to speak for scientists:

*But as the Met Office's chief scientist Julia Slingo put it, "all the evidence suggests that climate change has a role to play in it". With 4% more moisture over the oceans than in the 1970s and sea levels rising, how could it be otherwise?*

That sounds like something I'd hear on FOX News (obviously about the opposing side though). There is no scientific majority, let alone consensus, that this event has been caused by ocean levels raising and additional moisture.  No single weather event can be said to be caused by global warming.

Of course global warming is real and we have to deal with it, but not every weather event is caused by it.  Maybe The Guardian is merely using it as a stage to bring larger issues to attention.
-----==----==---==-----
I think that the recognition that the current corporate centric status quo is poorly situated to deal with climate change has been well known for a long time.

Or at least the point where I concluded that it was absolutely pointless to engage with dedicated deniers was in the early 2000's when such a person firmly asserted that the reason that climate change was *clearly* a hoax invented by "collectivists" was that all of the most reasonable proposed actions to combat it were "collectivist in nature".  That's just flatly rejecting reality because it's inconsistent with a particular &amp; preferred world view... along the lines of young earth creationism and the flat earth society.

Moreover, given how obvious it is that most of denier playbook has been straight out lifted from the old tobacco doesn't cause cancer playbook... it's pretty obvious that anyone who is swayed by it almost certainly sought out a narrative which confirmed their worldview.

Personally, I see the whole thing as a sort of cautionary tale for all of us.  Every time I read some pro-socialist or anti-capitalist article, I force myself to read with a more skeptical and cautious mindset.  The last thing I want to do is latch on to something that, while it might make me feel good because it confirms my world view, turns out to be complete bullshit.

"Existing everyday problems faced by Venezuelan society, such as insecurity, high inflation, and shortages -probably caused by a mix of economic sabotage and the ineffectiveness of an increasingly hypertrophied and corrupt state- were used as excuses for the students’ mobilisations. However, these are situations that have existed for some time now, that have not lost the government any elections, and where no significant changes have been verified in recent times. The most recent objective change in Venezuela’s situation seems to be within the opposition, rather than the government."

People are protesting because the economy is failing on some really basic levels. Their are shortages of basic products. In addition to this people are not happy with the levels of crime and apparent corruption in politics. Much of the media is biased in favour of one form of politics of another but obviously that doesn't not reflect on the protesters themselves who have no say over how the media acts.
-----==----==---==-----
The socialist party is extremely weak and vulnerable post-Chavez because many voters apparently were drawn to him more than the Party as a whole. See: [2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012) Presidential election vs [2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2013). 

This in turn means the opposition is stronger, and they are taking any opportunity they can get to seize power. With the poor state of the economy, the protesting, etc, i think it's very likely that the next major election will see massive losses by the socialist party and any dreams of a socialist venezuela will be pretty much gone. But I guess this is what happens when you put all your eggs in one basket. Or one man.

When a government shuts off the internet, you know this is more than a counter-revolutionary manufactured protest.  This is for real, fellas.  People are really suffering in Venezuela.  When that happens, you don't just fall in line with a government because they call themselves socialist.  A government is good so long as it serves its people, regardless of how it labels itself.

This is a comment from [this](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/not-satisfied-with-blocking-twitter-and-tv-venezuela-shut-off-the-internet) article:

"A coup typically doesn't happen with unarmed students in the streets. No channel should be blocked and that's the point of a democracy, allowing opposition to exist. You can't say, "We legally won the elections!" and then everything else you do is ilegal. Crying coup is not going to get Maduro out of the mess he's in. By the way, the government has had 14 years to prove it's good intentions towards the people. And? The US has bought oil form Venezuela all these years and hasn't interfered in the countries affairs. To say that students and much of the population are puppets of the US is a cowardly insult. To call them fascists is ridiculous. To say that anybody who doesn't agree with you is trying to start a coup, especially when they're unarmed students goes to show that your argument is null. The facts and images speak for themselves. Plus, Maduro last night said he was going to give free "tablets" to the students. Buying them off now? Why doesn't he talk to the little birds that help him communicate with the beyond, so that their murdered student friends can come back to life instead."

I'm sorry to be so harsh with these words but this kind of apologism for dictatorial and authoritarian regimes is part of the reason why socialist has fallen out of the mainstream.  PRIORITIES, people.

sure there is, products aren't just physical things they can also be actions. the cutting of hair and the serving of food have use values, that is, they are useful actions. When use values are created for exchange they are then endowed with exchange value, i.e they exchange for some value. Exchange value can only exist because all commodities are objects of labor. So it is the fact that the barber is exchanging his action of cutting your hair that the action has value, even though it always had and always will have a use-value.
-----==----==---==-----
A commodity doesn't have to be immediately tangible, it just has to have a use-value and a value (exchange-value). So the commodity being sold is the human service in question, it just stops existing once the service rendered ceases.
-----==----==---==-----
Think of it like this: What people buy in a market is always labor, not the object itself. In capitalism, value seems to emanate from the commodity itself, but in actuality value should be attributed to the labor behind commodities.

Sometimes this value (labor) is incorporated into a material object (a transformation of raw material) that we can hold, other times we buy the labor itself in the form of service (commodities=goods &amp; services). The point that LTV makes is that the labor underlying commodities explains why things have value. 

The service industry is explained simply by the fact that service is composed of labor.

Just because the people in power agree with you, philosophically, doesn't mean they can't be authoritarian.

The concern trolling of Comrade Maduro and the people's government in Venezuela by so-called socialists is all too much. The fact is Americans and Western Europeans have ZERO right to criticize the actions of the Venezuelan government because they are beneficiaries of the imperialist exploitation of the Latin American masses.
-----==----==---==-----
Why is /r/socialism like v 2.0 of /r/communism?  The government has failed to meet basic life needs and rights of the people and now is turning to censorship.  Just because there may be the term "socialist" or "socialism" attached to the government or president does not make them good or free from criticism.  
-----==----==---==-----
How do you stop this kind of attempted coup? Most people hate the use of violence by the state against protesters because the protesters are normally the "good guys," but what if they aren't? What if they are trying to get back in to power illegitimately because no one really wants them? And they say they wont stop until the current leaders step down. Is force warranted in this case? 
-----==----==---==-----
Sorry but socialism in Venezuela has not panned out well for a lot of reasons. The government is corrupt and mismanaged. The sooner they can get rid of them the better.

I don't know that it is too much text but the spacing makes it hard to read.

It kindof lookslikethere are nospaces between some words.

Other than the spacing I'd say it's pretty good, maybe you could have made the background black and white as well, as well as use less text and use the segments that give the main idea.

This does not comport with independent media coverage of the protests and this essay does not offer any evidence to back up the claims within (other than some correct but generalized analysis of U.S. foreign policy).  There are some far right elements in the protests, but the bulk seems to be dominated by center or left individuals.  Fascism is the catch all term the Russian government and Russian controlled media use to smear any opposition to Russian interests.  This article reads like a Russian smear piece.  The perspective is clear in that it fails to direct any criticism at Russian policies or the Ukrainian government's "fascist" anti-protest laws and militarized response to the protest.

Both of these accounts are more insightful:

GOD DAMN IT!! Which is it!? I don't know who to believe anymore! I can't tell who the good guys are in Ukraine or Venezuela!

There seems to be, in both countries, evidence to support that the protesters are the bad guys (which is counter-intuitive to me). 

I have been following the protests in Ukraine, and was very much on the side of Maiden. But now their Fascists? I was aware that some of them were right-wing, but I was under the impression that they had the same agenda as other protestors to oust the corrupt president and democratically elect new officials. 

And now with Venezuela, the media is painting the government to be evil, when it seems the protesters are the real evil there. Trying to regain power so they can send more money to the top like they do in the US.

This is a fucking shit show. I am reminded of Aldus Huxley's "Brave New World," and the idea that there will be so much information we wont be able to make heads or tails of it.

This is not good.

p.s.

There is an increase in Fascist ideology and its quite alarming to me. Check out this shitty sub: /r/DarkEnlightenment. These dudes are bat-shit.
-----==----==---==-----
One clue that the "protesters" are bad guys is that the US news presents them favorably.

You should look up the recommendations of the 1967 Royal Commission on Taxation in Canada (known as the Carter Report); it wasn't calling for a flat tax or anything, but did have the idea that "a buck is a buck" and that all income should be taxed equally. In this reform alone, the power of the elites would be limited deeply due to the preferential rates they get on investment income.  
-----==----==---==-----
But, see, the libertarians and the rest of the extreme right wing agree with you, so it'll never happen.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't blame them for what they did. Republican legislators were making threats over the union vote that probably made many workers feel that their jobs would be at risk if they unionized. At the end of the day, most people just want to have a job and support themselves and their ambitions. 
-----==----==---==-----
"May" have?
-----==----==---==-----
So we're blaming the working class for this? VW wanted the UAW because they proved themselves to be faithful servants to the automakers in Detroit. Rejecting the UAW was a class conscious decision on the part of workers at the Chatanooga plant, and I hope they would do it a hundred times over.
-----==----==---==-----
As a Venezuelan, I cannot condone the violent actions on either side, but the opposition on the streets have good reasons to be upset with the way the government is running. There have been numerous social advances during the Chavez administration, and they've pretty much continued with Maduro, namely the masification of education and healthcare at a national level, available for all strata of society, and the nationalization of many key industrial sectors we need to be an independent country, not depending from transnational corporation or other hegemonic powers.

But in the other hand, you have rampant crime, shortages of food, and blatant corruption from many in the high spheres of government. And unless this problems have been tackled, and the people see results from them, we're gonna see more and more people joining the guarimberos.

Add to the fact that the opposition *is* a significant part of the country (at least 40% of the population) and that there's been little dialogue between them both (thanks to the hardliners, right-wing vociferous leaders on one hand, and the almost-obstinate ignorance of the opposition as a whole by Maduro), the situation is going to worsen up until either side caves, or goes up in arms against the other.

I just hope that the moderate opposition and the government decide to talk, recognize mistakes, and work for the betterment of the country.
-----==----==---==-----
This article is good insofar as it shows the source of funding for the "student" movement in Venezuela, and the internal conflicts in the right-wing.  

However, let's not pretend like the current chaos is just a repeat of 2002.  [There are plenty of poor folks and disgruntled *chavistas*](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/20/venezuelas-poor-protests-chavez-revolution) who are taking part in the protests as well, due to the chronic food shortages that have persisted for the last year.  

The situation is much more complicated than 2002.  Maduro is far less popular than Chavez was, and the current administration has not done a good job of dealing with the economy.

&gt;What should the Federal Reserve be doing with its policy from a Socialist's perspective?

Destroying itself.
-----==----==---==-----
[deleted]
-----==----==---==-----
It shouldn't exist. If anything, it should be moving the capital to workers instead of bailing out the leeches.
-----==----==---==-----
While in the past one could have argued that a "loose" money policy theoretically increases demand for labour, thereby boosting worker power, it seems that recent quantitative easing hasn't been particularly effective to that end. So I don't think that this particular debate over monetary policy is especially relevant to core socialist goals.
-----==----==---==-----
They should give all their money to various communist groups in the US, resign, and burn the Reserve to the ground
-----==----==---==-----
Coming at this from a Socialist perspective will be difficult, if not impossible, given that the current federal reserve works to ensure an efficient and well-run Capitalist banking industry and financial oligarchy. I'd go with abandoning the rhetoric and just looking at the current economic state.

As to whether they should continue quantitative easing, absolutely not. The policy's drawback led to a mini-crisis in emerging markets, and continuing it will only delay and exacerbate the problems we're seeing. Such massive adjustment of the economy is going to have some unintended consequences, and keeping up the bond buying program would be an astoundingly terrible attempt at trying to escape and ignore that reality. 
-----==----==---==-----

I'm pro free trade and even still I find some of the contents of the TPP ludicrous. 

I'm from Australia, were are close to the most free trade country on the OECD. However we still have a decent amount of progressive politics. One issue that's particularly pertinent to the TPP is our world leading plain packaging of cigarette packets. Our ciggie packets all look the same, the brand appears only as a small label in plain white font. The packages are grey green with images of diseases resulting from ciggarettes on them. Big tobacco wants to sue us for this policy hurting their profits, the TPP may allow them to. That is not free trade, it doesn't allow different countries to pursue the industries they are most efficient at and enjoy the benefits of comparative advantage - it allows money to overrule democratic government. 

Its not like we have said "Australian tobacco companies don't have to abide by plain packaging, but imports do" its got fuck all to do with trade. Its got to do with the fact that our country overwhelmingly supports us taking steps to make profiting from the provision of cigarettes more difficult, regardless of what country they are produced in or where the business that produce them are owned. The TPP will open up the same threats to environmental policies and is seriously a threat to democracy all around the world.
-----==----==---==-----
That's my comic!

Thanks for posting it.

-----==----==---==-----
"it's difficult to argue with experts" isn't a reason why things like TPP get pushed.  Arguing from this position leads to many weaknesses and problems with any discussion that ensues.  The reason is people have economic interests and they benefit tremendously from trade deals.  Those people use their power to influence corrupt governments.  If you look at public opinion, few are fooled by trade deals.  NAFTA was tremendously unpopular 20 years ago and still is.  

And then why bring China into?  They are purposefully excluded from TPP.  Also the idea that China is a giant sentient robot that vacuums up money is, first, wrong.  Second, potentially playing on xenophobia.  Certainly the ruling class in China is accumulating massive profits and to some degree those profits are sloshing about the country and trickling down to the working class.  But a significant amount of the wealth is flowing right back to the US and away from China.  Apple is a well known company to let's use that as an example.  Very little of the value produced in China stays in China.  The actual manufacturer of iPhone is Taiwanese IIRC and of course the lion share of value returns to Cupertino.  

And then it starts talking about stimulus and tax cuts. 

I stopped reading after that.. 

Anyway, the other side of changes in nation-state sovereignty brought about by trade deals is a positive for forging international working class solidarity.  
-----==----==---==-----
Okay, I'm not a free marketeer per say, and I don't know if such opinions are welcome here, but there are a lot of fallacies within this little comic but it does make a lot of good points. 
1) It's not completely fair to say that trading with China is BAD because we are giving some sentient robot some weapons. Because many of us are benefiting from cheap manufactured goods from China, just as the Chinese benefit from acquiring capital. I'm pretty sure most of us here (including me) are not willing to give up our cheap manufactured goods for not giving the Chinese our capital in the form of a boycott. We all make the decision to make that trade. And it is not totally fair to say that the US is entitled to hog all the capital because China is some evil machine. The Chinese deserve a better standard of life too.

2) That is a good example of something that is anti-free market. Governments "rigging" the game so to speak and is a very good reason for why a true "free market" is an ideal rather than a reality. But yes, very few people realize that playing the "free market" game can just reward those who manipulate the game. 

3) Actually the model still holds up if we assume that Icelandic businesses move to Guatemala. Because in essence you still have labourers or workers in Iceland that can produce goods. And it is not as easy to move workers to Guatemala as it is to move a business. As long as each country can produce goods, the advantages of trading benefit both countries. But it is important to note that not all goods are easily outsourced. High tech jobs usually go to more educated countries and are harder to outsource because it requires high amounts of human capital which is not available in 3rd world countries. Unemployment I think is more linked to the fact that technology is increasing efficiency so dramatically that its starting to reveal some inherent problems of the wage system.

4) Investing, capital and saving are not the same thing. When foreigners come to buy capital they come in the interest of making some investment (that is bonds, stocks, or real estate that is going to give them a profit, if the investment succeeds). This is good in the sense that it creates interdependencies between countries. For example a Chinese who is heavily invested in the American economy wants the American economy to succeed. The lack of investment isn't problem of trading. It's not that one side is gaining capital and the other is gaining nothing. Trading of capital actually liquifies these assets into liquid capital: dolla bills, which can be more useful in certain scenarios (less risks and more circulation). The lack of investing however is NOT a result of trade but has to do more with 1) the lack of confidence in the market, 2) greed and American corporate culture, 3) many economists admit that they are quirked by the recent recovery and its lack of investments.

5) IMO, I believe an IDEAL free market or perfect competition is affective in creating a fair system in current settings:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition
HOWEVER, as you can tell perfect competition is rather idealistic and doesn't exist in an anarchic environment of no regulations as a lot of people claim. A free trade agreement, I think, should reflect the ideals of an actually fair system. But you know legislation, people will always find a way to include special interests or to rig the game. Trade is not bad. What is bad is when people try to rig trade. I hate conservatives who are so pro free market but then when it comes  to outsourcing they wanna stop immigration. They actually don't care about free markets; they care about benefiting themselves and rigging the game for corporates. A lot of socialist/mixed economies have implemented a free, competitive market much better then those who claim it.

I think its going to take more than a pamphlet to convince most of the robots in the west that socialism is not pure concentrated evil. There is just so much information that people are unfamiliar with that is necessary to understand socialism, then there are the ideological barriers. I think it is much easier to start with unionism. I'm sure there are a lot of pamphlets promoting unions. Or you could put one together yourself. They gave us the 40 hour work week btw. ;)

Go to cuba, go to the hotels for the middle then upper class.
Go talk to the poor and hear how they are banned from moving to Havana for a better life.

There is a great book, its not about socialism but rather Science, by Donald Sutherland called [*Irrationality*](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-XZ9MAEACAAJ&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks). One of the things this covers is the notion of incentives, which has been dismissed by Psychologists, conclusively, as a way of improving performance for non-menial tasks since about the 1960s.

It should also be read by anyone for the simple reason that, as a product of biology, *you are not a rational person*. The idea of some superhuman, rational brilliant leaders, scientists or businessmen is completely wrong.

couple of excerpts: 

&gt;AMY GOODMAN: Your response to [Obama's] response . 

&gt;STEPHEN COHEN: To what he just said? Shame. Shame. He is saying that the responsibility for restoring peace is on the Ukrainian government, and it should withdraw its security forces from the streets. 

&gt;**But let me ask you, if in Washington people throwing Molotov cocktails are marching on Congress—and these people are headed for the Ukrainian Congress—if these people have barricaded entrance to the White House and are throwing rocks at the White House security guard, would President Obama withdraw his security forces? This is—this is—and do you know what this does? And let’s escape partisanship here. I mean, lives are at stake. This incites, these kinds of statements that Obama made. It rationalizes what the killers in the streets are doing. It gives them Western license, because he’s not saying to the people in the streets, "Stop this, stop shooting policemen, stop attacking government buildings, sit down and talk."** 

&gt;And the guy you had on just before, a so-called moderate leader, what did he just tell you? "We have lost control of the situation." That’s what I just told you. He just confirmed that. 

&gt;So what Obama needs to say is, "We deplore what the people in the streets are doing when they attack the police, the law enforcement official. And we also don’t like the people who are writing on buildings 'Jews live here,'" because these forces, these quasi-fascist forces—let’s address this issue, because the last time I was on your broadcast, you found some guy somewhere who said there was none of this there. All right. What percent are the quasi-fascists of the opposition? Let’s say they’re 5 percent. 

&gt;I think they’re more, but let’s give them the break, 5 percent. But we know from history that when the moderates lose control of the situation, they don’t know what to do. The country descends in chaos. Five percent of a population that’s tough, resolute, ruthless, armed, well funded, and knows what it wants, can make history. We’ve seen it through Europe. We’ve seen it through Asia. This is reality. And where Washington and Brussels are on this issue, they won’t step up and take the responsibility. 


&gt;She said, "F— the European Union," and everybody said, "Oh, my god! She said the word." The other thing was, who leaked it? "Oh, it was the Russians. Those dirty Russians leaked this conversation." But the significance is what you just played. What are they doing? 

&gt;**The highest-ranking State Department official, who presumably represents the Obama administration, and the American ambassador in Kiev are, to put it in blunt terms, plotting a coup d’état against the elected president of Ukraine.**

&gt;Now, that said, Amy, Juan, you may say to me—neither of you would, but hypothetically—"That’s a good thing. We don’t like—we don’t care if he was elected democratically. He’s a rat. He’s corrupt." And he is all those things. He is. "Let’s depose him. That’s what the United States should do. 

&gt;**Then the United States should stand up and say, ’That’s what we do: We get rid of bad guys. We assassinate them, and we overthrow them.’" But in Washington and in Brussels, they lie: They’re talking about democracy now. They’re not talking about democracy now; they’re talking about a coup now.**

This is a very useful quote from this interview:
&gt;there’s an unfortunate tendency, if you follow Twitter or if you’re on the Internet, that, you know, in this sort of post-Occupy moment and in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, every time we see—every time we see protesters in the streets, we start retweeting it, and we start to sort of, you know, feel sympathetic, without necessarily knowing what the back story is

I propose something very simple: Look at Colombia. The Colombian government is the lapdog of the US. In fact, I think it's sometimes referred to as the Israel of Latin America. The military has been at war with the various leftist factions that broke away from the mainstream in the 40s and the conflict is hands down the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the hemisphere currently taking place. This results mainly from the huge amounts of military aid from the US that finds its way to funding tolerated paramilitary groups that commit awful crimes including political assassinations. There is war against leftist militias but poor campesinos and other vaguely left-sympathizing groups often also fall into the cross hairs. Hundreds of union leaders have been assassinated. This is what would happen in Venezuela if the government is defeated. 

What is at stake seems to be not only the fate of Venezuela but also all the countries in the region. A coup would be a success for US imperialism and would also validate the actions of the military and paramilitary groups in Colombia (and elsewhere) that act with impunity.

"A top State Department official, Victoria Nuland, and the US ambassador in Kiev. The media predictably focused on the source of the “leak” and on Nuland’s verbal “gaffe”—“Fuck the EU.” But the essential revelation was that high-level US officials were plotting to “midwife” a new, anti-Russian Ukrainian government by ousting or neutralizing its democratically elected president—that is,"
Thats in Europe. What wouldnt the USA do in its own so called backyard?

I wish I could take the bus to this guy's house and give him a big old hug, but it's definitely for the best that his address isn't revealed. Sounds like it's close to me, though.

Cities like Toledo, Cleveland, Flint, and Detroit - the rustiest part of the rust belt and where I grew up and live - are the best argument against private property. Look at the way these companies hoard land and houses with no end but an unattainable profit while huge homeless populations are left out in the streets. Abolition of private property would mean every one of those homeless people were homeless no longer.

&gt;"European Union foreign ministers have agreed to impose sanctions on Ukrainian officials "responsible for violence and excessive force".

&gt;In a statement, they said targeted sanctions including asset freezes and visa bans would be introduced "as a matter of urgency".

&gt;At least 21 anti-government protesters died in clashes in Kiev on Thursday.

No sanctions are being placed on the Ukraine.
-----==----==---==-----
Not surprised, the brutal crackdown on the protests and the deaths of dozens of protesters have obviously caught the attention of the western world. The question is, will it have any effect on the morale of the protesters in a positive manner as a way of saying that the EU does not support Yanukovych's government, or will it hurt them by letting them think they have been abandoned?
-----==----==---==-----
I can only respect these sanctions if they are also applied to "Opposition" leaders, especially including teh Nazi ones, and their various formations.

Even if the government may be more or less corrupt, and may have reacted heavy-handedly, that "repression" has clearly occurred in the face of extreme provocation by ultra-violent nazi cadres and their dupes.

For EU to be supporting or favoring, or sympathizing with such extreme rightwing elements seems absolutely unconscionable.

There is a lot of large stories which are dominating discussions, but the developments in Bosnia are unique in that the working class have taken over cities (Tuzla) and ran politicians out of town - the local police forces laying down their weapons and refusing to enforce bourgeois laws. Why? Because the workers of Tuzla have demonstrated clearly *that they are more powerful*.

What is the next step then? The formation of public assemblies: Plenums. And this has spread across Bosnia - not just in Tuzla and Sarajevo, but in Brcko, Bugojno, Fojnica, Konjic, Mostar, Orasje, Travnik and Zenica. The article points out some of the restrictions: *No politicians*. And also lays out their demands clearly (unlike what was done in General Assemblies, in, say the OWS movement).

Take for example, the plenum of Sarajevo's demands, [just demanded yesterday.](http://www.sarajevotimes.com/representatives-plenum-received-copies-decisions-dismissal-tuzla-canton-government/). Already concessions are being made - politicians, for long times dividing the working class and getting fat from corruption, are resigning if not being run out of town left and right. The primary drive of this has been the working class. This separates Bosnia from other larger conflicts which are ongoing in Ukraine, Thailand, and Venezuela.
-----==----==---==-----
I am positively surprised of the retenting success of the actions undertaken by the Bosnian and Herzegovinan people... I really thought it was going to end up like it did in Brazil with the Movimiento Passe Libre.

Let's hope that no aggressive foreign intervention will jeopardize the fate of the country like in Ukraine.
-----==----==---==-----

That case?  Probably both, but edging towards imperialism.

The best way to help the workers of foreign nations is through solidarity.  The distribution of propaganda, and then arms, to the workers can help them achieve class consciousness on their own, and they shall take it upon themselves to rid their country of the whole bourgeoisie.  This shall permit unto the proletariat full autonomy in matters of their own, free of intervention from foreign nations.  Not that the "nation" would have the same meaning under international socialism.  The only revolution is a global revolution.

--Pre-emptive Edit -- 

I know that's not strictly true, I mean, the Russian Revolution was **a** revolution.  What I'm trying to say is "only a global revolution can fully achieve socialism". 
-----==----==---==-----
People have a right to revolt against their government; I don't dispute the protesters that.

What sickens me about all of this is the interference from other countries -- in particular, the US. To hear the moralizing on our radio and TV propaganda outlets about the Ukrainian gov't crushing the protests, I cannot help but to think of the hypocrisy about people struggling to overthrow an elected gov't, and one that is scheduled to have elections next year.

What would the US gov't do if protesters were throwing rocks and molotov cocktails at, and burning cars outside of the White House and US Capitol?

Could you imagine the response of the US gov't if Democrats revolted in 2000 because of the rigged election of George Bush?
-----==----==---==-----
Another fun-fact: The next election in Ukraine is in 2015.

So why does the opposition simply not just wait and see? The majority of Ukranianan people actually would still vote in favour of Janukowytsch, so a violent revolution is the only way how the western hemisphere can install free-trade aka democracy and weaken russia. It's again only geopolitics.

Why else would right-wing extremists support a movement against a **elected** president and justify it with democracy? 


Edit: I don't think shooting on unarmed protesters is justifiable, I just do not support the movement and do not agree with the euphemistic claims that it is democratic what's happening in Kiev.
-----==----==---==-----
It's fair to see this side. But the police still have an active policy of shooting unarmed protesters and their medics. 
-----==----==---==-----
The entire situation is a harsh, bloody, and vicious mess. Just today, over a hundred people died in the capital from violence on both sides after the truce broke down. These protests started out peaceful, but as with everything, the radicals began to take control and cause damage. It's good that you are showing both sides here OP, but I think that most people are going to support the protesters given that having the police fire sniper rounds into the crowds doesn't endear yourself to the populace (al-Assad could probably tell some people about that in depth).

The people will decide what they want, but I am not looking forward to the future of the Ukrainian protests; today's death count has shed light on why standing for what you believe in can be dangerous for both sides.
-----==----==---==-----
I really wish there was less viciousness in the violence and a larger presence from the left in these protests/riots, because I generally agree that the actions of the Ukrainian government should be condemned. Regardless of how you feel regarding the initial EU/Russia agreement, the anti protest laws are absurd and despite violence from the civilians, you'd have trouble convincing me that the police response has been proportionate. 
-----==----==---==-----
I have the feeling that some people on this subreddit romanticize every revolutionary movement whether or not it is actually something good what it will cause to Ukraine, especially if the opposition wins.  

Of course they would always claim that the last election was rigged, it is publicity and works perfect with western media and its stupid average-watchers. The media always will circlejerk for weeks if any by foreigners supported oppositionist claims that a election, mostly because they lost, was rigged. Same worked perfectly with russia after the 2012 election. All presidents who are not coorperating with the global neoliberal clockwork need to be potrayed as some evil-tyrannic-dictators and not as actually elected presidents.

Who supports the joining of the Ukraine to the EU supports the globalization and weakens one of the few non pupet states of America - Russia. Exploiting Ukraines economy and weakening Russia is the whole point, thats why the Media is talking so emotional and unreflective about it 24/7 right now. Not long and the western countries will support the Demonstrates with weapons like they did in Syria. They probably already do but it is not commonly known yet. 

-----==----==---==-----
As far as the claim that the mainstream media isn't showing the protesters acting out violently - total bullshit. Just because Obama called them "peaceful protesters" doesn't mean that the US media did too. Don't get me wrong, they try very hard to sympathize with them, but you pretty much wouldn't be able to show any footage of the activity on the ground **at all** without showing violent protesters. CNN reported just today with video of protesters throwing molotov cocktails and even showed **one protester firing a shotgun in the direction of police**. I mean to claim that the mainstream media is or is *not* doing something, you have to actually watch it. I know because I usually don't watch CNN or any other source like that. 

Edit: I just sometimes can't understand the idiotic claims against the media. I heard someone today claim that there is a media blackout in Venezuela. Just because they aren't showing the bullshit videos from the internet that you watched doesn't mean there is a blackout. That goes without saying that there is at least a plurality in Venezuela - some media is anti-government but some is also pro-government.

The sample text is a bit mission-statement-buzzwordy, but has some solid ideas underlying it.

I think it could stand to be more straightforward. Like, "Let's introduce more cultural and even political content to schools, and let kids question the things current schools tell them to learn by rote and give them the tools to academically challenge such claims," instead of the amount of text spent conveying those ideas in the article.

Is there a list of the "30 top progressive thinkers" somewhere. I might be interested in the book, but generally I'm skeptical about things like this. For example, I've never been impressed by anything written or said by William Ayers, so I'm a bit hesitant to spring for a book like this.
-----==----==---==-----
I just picked up this book from kobo after seeing this article. I very much recommend it. It gives a model of how a socialist usa could work, why we need it, but not so much how to get there (leaving that to others to teach)

Not many things too groundbreaking to learned socialists though it does teach us to think about the details, such as how to handle food.

I think this is a wonderful book for anyone still learning about this ideology and for spreading these ideas.

Venezuela is a democratic society, so power is subject to changing hands every so often.

I don't necessarily trust the administration to censor the internet, but I certainly wouldn't trust any other party to if they happened to win an election. 

Using censorship over the internet to 'ban' capitalist ideas and subvert political opposition, to me, demonstrates a lack of faith in the people. If you don't have faith in the public's ability to make good political choices, the ruling party shouldn't claim to be a democracy. 
-----==----==---==-----
Could you elaborate, I havent heard of it
-----==----==---==-----
As an American, the Venezuela protests are grabbing my attention way more than the Ukrainian ones. Mainly just because it's harder for me to understand the background of the issues once you move out of the American sphere of influence.

Technically the internet crackdown is now a human rights violation according to the UN, and I back that line of thought. Too many pictures of cats are at stake. I understand the government's fear of private media, but I don't think this is any way to swing opinion towards their favor. And they're gonna need some more popularity soon too because fire
-----==----==---==-----
Well, I'm not against censoring the bourgeoisie and their political toadies at all. Freedom of the press under capitalism is limited to those that own them, and I'm in favour of taking the means of communication from the ruling class. That said, I don't think that it's really useful at all to do things like block images on twitter, it's a mistake that sets a bad precedent for sure.

However, I'm not sure how blocking access to two websites and temporarily blocking images on twitter counts as an "internet crackdown" any more than the norm in even liberal "democracies." [Here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_States) a particularly fucked up example from the US:

&gt; On July 3, 2011, two officers of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Police shot and killed Charles Hill at Civic Center Station in San Francisco.[74] On August 12, 2011, BART shut down cell phone services, including mobile Internet access, for three hours in an effort to limit possible protests against the shooting[75][76] and to keep communications away from protesters at the Civic Center station in San Francisco.[77] The shutdown caught the attention of international media, as well as drawing comparisons to the former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in several articles and comments.[78]

Don't worry, they've agreed to only ever do it again under "emergency" conditions. Or what about David Cameron's super messed up internet censorship pet project currently [going down](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/03/david-cameron-internet-porn-filter-censorship-creep) in the UK. Not only will porn be blocked by default, but also "inappropriate" and/or "extremist" websites, leaving it up to the state to define what qualifies as such. And this is to say nothing of capitalist states spying intimately and illegally on the internet activities of just about everyone online.
-----==----==---==-----
I support some censorship of the Internet to prevent the spread of things like child pornography and capitalist ideas, so I don't really have a problem with what Venezuela's doing.
-----==----==---==-----
I see the censorship of the internet in the context of the opposition's [widespread usage](http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/10360) of old, unrelated photos to create indignation among the population. In this sense, it really just seems to be an measure that unfortunately needed to be taken in the government's pragmatic efforts to stop violence and instability. I think it's important to focus on why the violence is occurring and why the country is being forcefully destabilized. These are of much immediate concern than some bourgeois notion of free speech. I don't support the spread of false information that results in death.

&gt;A crucial aspect of social control is the facilitation of private lending, which encouraged a culture of consumption and pushed many people into the debt trap. According to the Palestine Monetary Fund, individual loans shot up to about a billion U.S. dollars in 2013 from about $494 million in 2009. It is estimated that 75% of public sector employees (94,000 out of 153,000) are in debt. The personal debt is primarily used to finance consumption (including mortgages, cars, marriage costs, and electric goods) and is rarely invested in productive activities. This state of personal indebtedness promotes a sense of individualism and drives personal private concerns, systemically pushing people to abandon crucial national issues. It fosters political apathy and undermines critical thinking and action against the oppressive nature of the system.

Somehow a major corporation pushing for workers to unionize seems to set off a lot of red flags to me.  What's VWs angle on all this?  Using a council to better enforce and control their workers without needing to directly dirty their hands?  Anyone have any insights into that side of the story?

Not to say that the workers are voting against their best interests due to FUD on part of Corker it seems.  Solidarity is still better than nothing.
-----==----==---==-----
I haven't been following this super closely but basically VW opened a plant in Tennessee, and the workers there got to vote whether to Unionize and they rejected the notion. Correct?

Let's be crystal clear what happened here. The PR firm that was employed was generally well known to have ties/contracts with the CIA. George W. Bush was the former head of the CIA.

In this case, the "nurse" (daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador) testified in front of a joint session of Congress. The president himself told the fictional story about the mean Iraqi troops stealing the incubators.

This was nothing less than the US gov't using the American people's tax money to wage a deliberate pro-war propaganda campaign of lies on the American people. And the most sad thing is they're doing similar campaigns today...

The answer you're looking for is essentially a mystery. It's reachable, but it is impossible to articulate. In the abstract, I would say: seek a spiritual experience. In concrete terms, this means: help others. That's the key.

I think we get depressed when we think we don't make any difference. 

I've decided that how a person lives makes a difference.

Even if we never win, even if we're just contributing some noise to civilization's trip down the tubes, it makes a difference.

You're seeing the world the way it is, and yes, that's discouraging. Maybe you should set different victory conditions. Try this: just by resisting, you win. Not because it makes you feel good or changes anybody's mind, but because it makes you an alive human being. Expose. Critique. Resist. 

I can't advise on how to avoid becoming embittered. I have more than a streak of cynicism. But it doesn't have to destroy you or make you miserable.

If you have the time, be active.  Join LGBT, anti-racist, feminist, environmentalist, or other progressive groups and be active in various work to help marginalized communities.  Granted, you'll encounter liberals, and granted, these organizations won't necessarily be radical, but at the same time, you'll be surrounded by people who want to make a difference and make things better.  And you'll feel like you're having an effect, however small, on changing the world.

Think about your efforts as small, but helpful.  It's entirely possible that we won't see a socialist world in our lifetimes.  But your efforts do play a part in making that world possible in the future.

When I'm at work, I don't talk to people much. I used to work with some bitter communists, but they quit or moved.

There are a few tips, but take awhile to fully grasp. I'd recommend the readings of William Blake, Alan Watts, Joeseph Campbell,  Terence McKenna for a better understanding of your place in the world. 

Just remember, you choose to live this life. Your story is your own, despite the weights that everyone wants to thrust upon your shoulders.

The fact i hide my views from co-workers is kinda sad seeing as we are all tradesmen. Everyone where i am is a Conservative so i have to watch what i say which basically leaves me with a small circle of friends to talk about this stuff with and none of them are nearly as radical as me. Pisses me off so much to hear people talk about how lower taxes will fix everything and more power to corporate. I just now stopped talking about politics at work because i was starting to be paid attention to which could cost me my job or respect of my co-workers. You think you have it bad man? Just learn to deal with idiots because you'll see a lot of them. You can always try to talk to people but that really depends on where you live. Really, i stopped being so bitter by just accepting it and moving on and saving my strength for someone who will listen and not judge me.

As echinops linked to Buddhism, I'd like to add: don't take this (the state of the world) seriously. Look, the world may be going to hell, but that doesn't mean you have to feel like going to hell with it. Being bitter is your choice. Marxism is a social perspective for social action, it's nothing to guide you to how to live your personal life and deal with your personal outlook. Stuff like Buddhism can be great aids in setting your personal life at ease while letting Marxism be your guide to social action. You came into this world without a choice, you remain alive without choice, and you'll die without a choice. If you're going to make a decision worth anything in this life, make the decision to enjoy what you can in this life because it's the only life you're living now. If you're going to be bitter, at least enjoy your bitterness like RedPrairieDog ;)

You're just one person, and you may not like it, but you aren't going to change the world if the world doesn't want to change. You can't force revolutions, so do what you can to spread awareness and take action, but the point is to enjoy whatever you do, and if you don't like what you're doing there is plenty in this world for you to do otherwise if you only open your mind to other ways of living and other places in this world. Success and failure are parts of life, we won't get everything we want and we have to accept that is ok and move on. One of the pitfalls of the SJ and feminist movement is that they would rather become embittered in a hopeless fight to change others' opinions instead of accepting that some won't be changed right now and that while you may not like it you can always choose to personally ignore it if you can't get away with it. The world doesn't revolve around you, don't expect to ever make it to, so don't be bitter about something you can't change.

&gt; Eventually, Americans grew angry at the sheer injustice of it all and rose up in revolution -- nah, just kidding.

I'm not going to say things are great in America right now.  But historically, revolutions have been associated with much worse conditions (than today, though in the comic, I'm sure the One Rich Guy would be under a guillotine).  For example, the Bolsheviks rose up in a tsarist Russia that was economically well behind Europe during a very draining and drawn out war (although revolution did also occur in Germany but didn't manage to secure state power).  Maoist ideas involve the poor, the nations exploited by the global rich, being the leaders in the revolution.

America is seeing greater inequality.  And this will likely lead to tensions - Occupy Wall Street certainly won't be the only mass movement in America as inequality widens, the economy destabilizes, and people begin to question capitalism.  But America is more likely to see social democratic policies instead of actual revolution in the face of a bold and healthy worker's movement.
-----==----==---==-----
The thing I find ridiculous about our society is that there are people that have BILLIONS of dollars and most people see nothing wrong with that. Then there's some who defend their right to make that much as if there are actual people that deserve that kind of money. The median wealth of an American adult is something like $40,000. Bill Gate's wealth is like $75 billion. He has almost 2 million times as much as the median adult. I thought it was supposed to be "you work harder you make more". So these fuckers worked millions of times harder than the avg. person? 
-----==----==---==-----
This is one of the big things that turned me away from capitalism,  just looking at the trajectory of wealth and wondering what the end goal was. Are they just trying to have all the money? Then what? Won't be much ofg an economy to use that money in.

What's happening in Ukraine is turning into one of the most democratic and organic revolution's I have seen. If you look at independence square (the focus of the revolution but by no means the entirety of it)  what you have in some senses is a perfect little peace of communism. The People there are spontaneously working together to provide food, shelter, medical assistance as well as ingenious defences against the security forces. Everybody works to help the cause. Everybody receives what they need. Everybody benefits. 

Yesterday I watched as a long line of people passed along bricks to the front line. There where old women, young men. All kinds of people. Nobody had to be there and nothing had to be as organised as it is. It's just happened. From the ground up. Now all around the country massive groups of protesters are seizing police stations. No looting. Nobody taking advantage. People are just strategically decapitating the oppressive arm of the state. No financial reward involved. People are just going to great length to create their vision of society and they are doing it for their fellow citizens.

I can't emphasize just what they have built in that square. It really is incredible. They even have cigarettes that you can have for free by going to designated spots. They even have a university tent where people are giving lectures. It's like a little society. 

Sorry for the rant. Had to get it out of my system after watching it all yesterday.

A government using 'counter-terror' laws against protestors and opposition leaders. 

&gt;“The declaration of an anti-terrorist operation differs from the imposition of a state of emergency only inasmuch as it doesn't need to be declared by the president and doesn't need to be approved by parliament,” Kost Bondarenko, director of Ukrainian Policy Institute, a Kiev-based think tank, said in an interview. “In fact, it opens up the possibility of the police using firearms and for the state to use the army against insurgents and terrorists."

http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-ukraine-antiterrorist-protests-20140219,0,3709188.story#ixzz2tojGKo00

And this is the result Borsch-Supan argues is supported by the empirical evidence: fewer hours of labor cannot increase the employment of wage labor but only reduce it. However, he admits to a rather interesting additional result of reduced hours of labor: Based on Borsch-Supan’s review of the literature, reduction of hours of labor seems to free up more disposable time for the worker but has no impact on real wages.

I'm torn on this topic because I usually lean left in terms of international affairs, but the Maduro gov's crackdown on journalism is pretty sketchy.

Never lived there, would love to hear more about it.

&gt;We can continue fighting over Lenin’s body or we can do what revolutionaries — including Lenin — have always done: evaluate the situation as it is and seek out new forms of organization and resistance that empower the working-class, regardless of what came before. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Rather than seeing the world through 100 years of Leninism and Trotskyism, adjusting by inches one way or another to improve their practice, we should seek to build something new that nobody else has even considered before, just as every revolutionary before us has done. After all, it is the creation of something new that is revolutionary, not the reconstruction of the old. We do not need to ignore history, but we do need to enthusiastically embrace the future.

&gt;Lenin did not have a Leninism to fall back on, and neither do we.

I agree wholeheartedly. Instead of fetishizing methods of organization that are over 100 years old we should be trying to build new organizational models. Lenin's model made sense, and worked, in Tsarist Russia, but the majority of the world *isn't* Tsarist Russia in 2014. Trying to make the Bolshevik model a one-size-fits-all type of organization for revolutionary parties is not practical and borders on being a formulaic application. How can Marxists claim the mantle of materialism while painting every situation with the broad brush of "Leninism" and its method of organization, without even questioning the practicality and suitability of its organizational methods in that specific revolutionary movement? Even Lenin said that the Bolshevik model was suited specifically to Russia's particular economic development and its own historical conditions.
-----==----==---==-----
Every time I bring up on forums or FB groups that the term Bolshevik is completely useless in first world countries, and we need to move away from the more statist elements of social organization, people freak the fuck out and call me an anti-communist. :|

Walmart 

Edit: I dont boycott them, I just don't shop there if there are alternatives.
-----==----==---==-----
WalMart and BP gas stations 
-----==----==---==-----
Walmart. Worked there for five months. It's as bad as you've heard.
-----==----==---==-----
Walmart, Chick-Fil-A
-----==----==---==-----
Walmart, BP, Nestle (probably the hardest), Whole Foods because they have dropped their prices below the store average to push out the local food Co-Op (among other reasons), and as many Koch-controlled corporations as I can. 
-----==----==---==-----
McDonalds, Wendys, Burger king, etc they dont pay people enough and that food is bad for you
-----==----==---==-----
I think, after reading some of the comments, the red herring of capitalist propaganda is influencing answers. It really shouldn't bother you that the capitalist system puts a lot of faith in the individual. The only difference in our movement is that we understand that power really lies in cooperation. It doesn't simultaneously mean that individuals lack impact. 

This is a forum where we can come together and organize.

We can organize boycotts. 

Organized boycotts are effective. 

None of us should be shopping at Walmart, because of their anti-labor tactics and general abuse of the social welfare system. (it is not a benefits package to learn about food stamps and medicare)
-----==----==---==-----
Papa Johns, Walmart, and Nike are the big ones for me though I of course realize there are tons of shitty companies that I'm still giving my money to.
-----==----==---==-----
Verizon, anybody that fucks with my internet freedom needs to be put down.
-----==----==---==-----
Walmart. I avoid shopping there unless I have absolutely no choice

Sans club, by association. 

Chik fil a, papa John's
-----==----==---==-----
Boycotting is a petty-bourgeois tactic. 

Working class people need the cheap goods sold at Walmart, manufactured by cheap child-labor, and don't have the money or time to go to farmers' markets and drink organic lattes.

The point is to agitate, educate, and organize towards revolution.
-----==----==---==-----
I use a book/app called [The Good Guide](http://www.goodguide.com). It rates products and companies on their health, environmental, and societal impacts. They explain all their criteria on the site. I don't consider this boycotting, I consider it dollar voting.
-----==----==---==-----
Chic-fil-a

For obvious
-----==----==---==-----
I participate in boycotting any businesses that do business with Israel.
-----==----==---==-----
I never go to Walmart or Sam's Club, or even Kroger.  I only go to Costco; they're unionized.
-----==----==---==-----
No, there are no businesses I, as an individual, refuse to interact with because of their policies. I prefer to interact with non-exploitative businesses, but because I live in a class (capitalist in my case) economy those kinds of businesses are few and far between.

Even the so called co-ops were I live are primarily consumer co-ops, and import most of their items for sale from firms whose financial records are not publicly available. Setting aside the undemocratic ownership of these co-ops, most of the products they sell are made by exploited workers. Again, this is because I, and most of us on reddit, live in a global capitalist economy.

Therefore, avoiding and particular business because of their policies, for a Marxist living in a capitalist society, is a bit like avoiding the detonation of a mine while residing in a minefield.
-----==----==---==-----
There seems to be a never ending list of people *not* to buy from.  My list isn't perfect, but I do my best to keep it up to date.  I feel that dollars are "votes".  If I buy something from a business, I am telling them, "I vote for you to do what you do.  I support you.  Please keep it up."  I try to vote my dollars as well as I can and buy US-made, labor-friendly products wherever possible (Note:  If you don't live in the USA, please buy from your country.)

My list of "no buys":
**Walmart** - Labor abuse
**BP** - Environmental abuse
**Cracker Barrel** - No gays and "Whites don't have to serve non-whites" policy
**Chick Fillet** - No gays
**Burger King** - Refused to serve paying Occupy Wall Street protesters
**Papa Johns and Wendy's** - Right wing propaganda
**Nestle** - Just...  Just fuck that guy
**A&amp;F** - "Our clothing is for white people"
**Barilla** - "Gays can buy another pasta"
**Anything Koch (Georgia Pacific, etc.)** - Labor abuse

I also try to spend my money positively by supporting my local power plant's renewable energy program, seeking out labor-friendly products online, and subscribing to organizational publications, and etc.  Is my strategy great?  No.  But it's what I can do right now.

Am I boycotting?  Not really.  I still buy what I need.  I just choose where to buy it from.  It's not like I'm keeping my money and abandoning workers.  I'm spending it where I feel the company management practices are less onerous.  A dollar is a vote.  Vote for what you want.
-----==----==---==-----
Don't think there is much of a point in boycotting specific companies or trying to "boycott the system" as I hear from time to time. An exception where I think boycotts can actually be useful is when they take on an anti-imperialist perspective such as the BDS campaign aimed at toppling Israeli apartheid. 
-----==----==---==-----
I try to avoid Wal-Mart when I can, but my family is concerned about money and would usually send me there for the low prices. :/

McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, other fast food places - Mostly because I don't want to put that shit in my body.
-----==----==---==-----
Sodastream

Any product with a barcode starting with 279

As much as possible; Nestlé

McDonalds
-----==----==---==-----
Any business involving animals, businesses that uses sweatshops (harder to determine, but I try), fast food, don't even live near a Walmart.
-----==----==---==-----
McDonald's, KFC, Burger King. I've been boycotting them since I was 16. I don't think boycotting is a substitute for political agitation, but I just hate them for so many reasons.

 Now that I'm vegan my hatred is even more solidified!

 I've been avoiding Coca Cola for about that long as well. I would try to avoid Monsanto, Nestlé, and Nike too.

 Individually boycotting things may not change much, but it makes a statement which influences people you know. I don't think it takes much to boycott a few of the biggest and worst corporations. 
-----==----==---==-----
As a socialist I'd try not to buy from any business. Obviously that's not possible. I don't believe it's possible to hurt massively large corporations by boycotts. The best you can do to overthrow them, short of a revolution, is to organise their worker into unions and then strike.
-----==----==---==-----
None. Boycotting is the tactic of liberals, and achieves nothing for socialists. 

Let's say there's a mass boycott on walmart, and let's say it has an impact. What do you think that impact is? Job cuts. As soon as profits fall, they'd cut jobs like crazy, and impose money saving conditions on their remaining staff. 

Well done, you've just ruined a metric fuckton of lives. 

Boycotts hit workers far harder than they'll ever hit capitalists.

EDIT: I'd also like to add that it's a very classist position to expect poor working class people to stop shopping at places that are cheap. It's so easy for people in comfortable financial positions, but for many of us it simply isn't possible.  
-----==----==---==-----
Particularly Walmart, Nestle, Coca-Cola. Overall though I try not to buy anything new unless from a local business.
-----==----==---==-----
Walmart
-----==----==---==-----
Walmart, BP, Exxon, Chiquita, Macys, Coke.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm not from the US, so it differs a bit for me. 
I do not buy anything from one brand which translates to "Country-Love" (Landliebe) because of their nationalistic bias.
I do not buy OCB-Papers (for cigarettes etc.) because they sponsored the Front National in France. 
I do not buy from Müller because they sponsored far-right movements.
-----==----==---==-----
Yep, Walmart. They're right by my house (of course they are, they're right by everyone's house) but I will not go there. I'll go out of my way to shop elsewhere.

But a good policy to live by is: "If you've seen them advertised, don't shop with them." Because if they're big enough to pay for ads on TV, they're probably too big to be healthy for society.
-----==----==---==-----
No, is there really a point to an individual boycotting? what can one person do? it is different if a party calls for a mass strike or a mass boycott, but what communist party who leads millions has done this? If I do not buy a hershey bar then the bourgeoisie does not care in the least, if I help lead a movement, then I will have done more than the person who goes the extra half mile and walks to target.
-----==----==---==-----
Walmart.
-----==----==---==-----
Shell, Nike, and McDonalds. Fuck capitalism, but those three are terrible. I also avoid BP.
-----==----==---==-----
Wallmart

Target

Chic-fil-a, and burger places in general (beef is terrible for the environment).

And, as soon as they increase the range I'm getting an electric car - the oil companies can disappear.

Actually, boycotts are very powerful tools - a loss of 1 or 2% can mean a big difference for many retailers, and their shareholders.  It worked quickly for Home Depot - they changed their source of lumber.
-----==----==---==-----
There's too many to list. Walmart and the large banks like Goldman, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are the worst offenders. They need to be shut down, not just changed, and the wealth they've accumulated for the small elite that run them needs to be given back to the people from whom they stole it. If we can dismantle some of the large companies that currently dominate the market in this generation, I'll consider the world a much better place and feel like a socialist objective was achieved.
-----==----==---==-----
Whole Foods and Papa John's and Target (ACA whining), Walmart because Walmart, Domino's Pizza, Chik-Fil-A, and others when I learn foul info. I think that consumer activisim is at least as important as direct political action.
-----==----==---==-----
Brick and mortar appliance and electronics stores.

They're overpriced,  treat their employees like shit, and the employees are actively encouraged to con customers. Right out of high school I used to work for one that has a service similar to best buy's geek squad (it wasn't best buy). We were encouraged to do shady, possibly illegal things to try to get more money out of the customer.  

For example we were told to charge customers $30 *per stick* of ram we installed *unless the customer realized that we essentially swindling them*. 


-----==----==---==-----
Exxon. Haven't been in one of their gas stations to get so much as air in my tires since they had that oil spill in Alaska and I'll never go back because they refuse to pay for the clean up.

Walmart because they are so anti-worker.

Ford. You couldn't give me one for free. Not since they refused to recall and fix their Pintos that were blowing up when rear ended because the company felt that it would be cheaper to just let people die and deal with it in court than to make the repairs.
-----==----==---==-----
Wal-Mart, BP, Chevron, Coca-Cola, Chic-fil-a, Hobby Lobby, Papa John's, Nike, and McDonald's.
-----==----==---==-----
Well, I think I should quit buying stuff on amazon...

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25397316
-----==----==---==-----
Wal. Mart. I boycott them.
-----==----==---==-----
* Walmart
* Chic-Fil-A
* Hobby Lobby
* Papa Johns
* Pizza Hut
* Dominoes
* BP
* Nestle
* Apple
* all major banks
-----==----==---==-----
Facebook, Amazon, Wal-mart.
-----==----==---==-----
I tend to not eat out-- so mostly Nestle.
-----==----==---==-----
Wal-Mart.
-----==----==---==-----
* Walmart: obvious reasons
* Target: see Walmart
* K-Mart: see Target
* Sears: see K-Mart (although I will reluctantly buy tools there)
* Chick-Fil-A: obvious
* In-N-Out: see Chick-Fil-A (although I will go there with out-of-towners - not a complete party pooper)
* major banks
* Guitar Center
* Papa Johns
* I avoid big chain fast food unless absolutely necessary
-----==----==---==-----
Nestle.  Fuck you, you can't buy a fucking river (or was it a well?).  However, there aren't any others that I would boycott individually.  Unless it is organised, it will not have any effect.
-----==----==---==-----
Walmart (obviously) and McDonalds, due to their clearly anti-worker policies and imperialist ideology.
-----==----==---==-----
Yes. More than a few. Apple, Sony, Microsoft are the big ones, but there are others. McDonald's comes to mind ......
-----==----==---==-----
Any fast food chain. Any fish, any pistachios, any pomegranates.  Wal-mart.  
-----==----==---==-----
LOT's of them. Whole Foods because their idiot CEO argued against health care for all (his argument was that people should just shop at Whole Foods and they would never need health care anyway). Anything related to Koch industries - which mostly means avoiding styrofoam. Walmart, all fast food restaurants, Papa John's Pizza, just to name a few   :-)
-----==----==---==-----
Walmart, papa John's
-----==----==---==-----
I hate Nestlé. But that shits hard to avoid, they own a lot of products. 
-----==----==---==-----
The Olympics. 

well, The IOC, but you get the idea. 
-----==----==---==-----
Walmart, Nestle, Chick-Fil-A, non-local "good food" (small-label organics and free-range, because those are staple local markets, and nationalizing the socially-responsible foods movement is the last thing I want, especially where I live.)
-----==----==---==-----
Chick-Fil-A (although I have never eaten there anyway), Sabra hummus, Max Brenner, Coca-Cola (when I can help it), McDonald's (although I'll admit there are times of weakness around Chipotle--owned by the same company), Starbucks

Most (but not all) of these are to respect the boycott of Israel, but others are for other, more universal ethical reasons.
-----==----==---==-----
All of the hatred for Walmart here reminds me of how my hometown's only real choice is Walmart. I believe there's still a Save-A-Lot, though. But prices are higher and it's less convenient and the IGA closed its doors on the opening day of the Super Walmart. Even the small, local grocery store went out of business because it couldn't deal with Walmart's prices. 

One of the things I'd heard was that Walmart made a deal with the suppliers of pop/soda so that they'd get the lowest prices, causing the amount the owner had to pay for them to go up. In my area, at least, pop is fairly rapidly consumed. So it wrecked his ability to sell his best selling item. Close to the end, he even started a policy of not having any in-store lights on during the daytime. Still couldn't match Walmart's prices. Really answered the question, "Who would go to a small, local grocer with a much cheaper Super Walmart just 7 miles away?" Answer: "Pretty much no one".

The kicker was that, after they got rid of nearly all of the competition, their prices shot right back up.

Oh, and for further context: My hometown has quite a bit less than 2,000 people in it and the population is decreasing. The next town over, where the Walmart is, has around 7k.
-----==----==---==-----
Paypal and Best buy/Geeksquad. PayPal for obvious reasons and geeksquad because they prey on peoples lack of knowledge's to take their money. 
-----==----==---==-----
the usual suspects for me, off the top of my head: walmart, chic-fil-a, BP, exxon, papa johns, all large banks, and the company that owns red lobster and olive garden (dardan restaurants i believe) 

edit: spelling
-----==----==---==-----
I mute the television on commercials. I hate the sound of people trying to sell me shit.

Put a fork in it, the Renewal Faction is done. They never had much going for them anyway. Their whole political starting point was the "disarticulation of the working class" that its far too hard to organize in the working class in modern America, and we shouldn't be too overly optimistic for building the left. There were some points to that, but it didn't really offer that much in terms of a strategy or anything else. So when they failed to win people over, it became an endless game of trying to find a new controversy, a new rope to grab onto, to prove that the ISO and the left were in "crisis". All these calls of "bureaucracy" "repressing dissenters" come from there. Heck, some of RF's disjointed proposals are even *less* democratic then what the ISO has now (the idea for the Steering Committee to be appointed by the National Committee instead of elected by the full convention as they are now). It got to be kind of sad. But then things got out of hand in the last few weeks as RF members got desperate, first baselessly accusing political opponents of being police snitches, then this whole mess on the leaked documents.
-----==----==---==-----
For anyone interested, [here is the Renewal Faction itself's case.](http://externalbulletin.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/assessing-the-year-long-inaction-regarding-charges-of-sexual-violence-in-the-iso/)

Important note:
&gt;In March 2013, a member of the Xville branch contacted a member of the ISOSC [Steering Committee] to report the fact that a third party had accused ‘Daniel’ of attempted rape. The ISOSC member said that they assumed the accusations were false and did not connect the Xville member with the ISODC [Disciplinary Committee]…The ISOSC member communicated that they brought the issue to the ISOSC , that the ISOSC discussed it and deemed it a local issue. (PCB#19, 18-19)

[...]

&gt;As members of the ISO, and of the U.S. left, we felt it necessary to publicly address this case. It is necessary to presume the innocence of the accuser rather than assume the innocence of the accused. By instinctively disbelieving a woman who brought a sexual assault complaint against a “leading” man; by exhibiting the same instrumentalism that puts survivors beneath the “promising futures” of assailants; the Steering Committee’s actions have reflected the sexist and patriarchal logic of capitalist society. This is all the more distressing after the crisis in the British SWP, which should have shook the whole left out of its complacency. The authors of the Xville document gesture towards this, and for that, we laud them. However, they fail to indict the Steering Committee for its gross negligence in dismissing the case. Had these charges not been presented publicly on Facebook, it is possible they would not have been addressed at all.

And their list of recommendations:
&gt;The ISO Renewal Faction proposes the following resolutions for the Convention:

&gt;-Convention demands to know the identities of the Steering Committee members who communicated with the Xville branch about the “Daniel” case.

&gt;-Convention bars the Steering Committee member who was contacted by the Xville Branch in September 2012 from holding any leadership and/or paid position in the ISO until the next Convention.

&gt;-Convention similarly bars the Steering Committee member who assumed that the allegations against “Daniel” were false and failed to intervene or involve the Disciplinary Committee.

&gt;-Convention directs the National Committee to name a commission to investigate the failure of the ISO’s national leadership and disciplinary bodies during the “Daniel” case; and to publish its report and recommendations in Socialist Worker. The commission may not include any members who sat on the Steering Committee or the Disciplinary Committee at any time from July 2012 through Convention 2014; or who otherwise have a conflict of interest. The commission must include at least two comrades who are not, nor have even been, members of the ISO.

You found an anti-communist circlejerk "in the wild" on /r/Conservative? Did you also "stumble upon" some fascism on stormfront?
-----==----==---==-----
What is it with /r/conservative and having quotes in the sidebar that are completely unrelated to conserving things?

Edit: Also, since I was banned from there after posting my very humble and non-insulting opinion (I swear), can someone please harshly and extensively lecture the people there appropriating Orwell? Be sure to mention that he took a bullet to the throat for full communism. Thanks.
-----==----==---==-----
They blurt the stereotype attacks, while ignoring the abuse, and suffering of workers in third world countries inside mega-corporate factories, the utter destruction of the environment, and the mass incursion of nations that sport oil/gold/chocolate etc using poor people with guns. All thanks to radical conservatism and capitalism.

 With their logic = Because the capitalist philosophy includes mass suffering and warfare, lets dismantle it completely and never adopt it again. Fight fire with fire. 

  On another note, the one argument I'm hit with is "you will run out of other people's money" basically you can't provide welfare/state programs because somehow, money dries up... I thought currency ROTATES around an economy?
-----==----==---==-----
Poor Faithful Guevara he's gonna get banned from /r/Conservative.... I doubt he minds.

&gt;They should put "please don't read George Orwell, because that might kill our lies" at the bottom.

In any economic system, money is usually the incentive just as it is in socialism.

&gt; JL: I thought the original Communist revolutionaries coordinated themselves a bit better and didn’t go around shouting about it. That was how I felt – I was really asking a question. As someone from the working class I was always interested in Russia and China and everything that related to the working class, even though I was playing the capitalist game.

&gt;At one time I was so much involved in the religious bullshit that I used to go around calling myself a Christian Communist, but as Janov says, religion is legalised madness. It was therapy that stripped away all that and made me feel my own pain.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;RB: I suppose workers’ control is about that…

&gt;JL: Haven’t they tried out something like that in Yugoslavia; they are free of the Russians. I’d like to go there and see how it works.

&gt;TA: Well, they have; they did try to break with the Stalinist pattern. But instead of allowing uninhibited workers’ control, they added a strong dose of political bureaucracy. It tended to smother the initiative of the workers and they also regulated the whole system by a market mechanism which bred new inequalities between one region and another.

&gt;JL: It seems that all revolutions end up with a personality cult – even the Chinese seem to need a father-figure. I expect this happens in Cuba too, with Che and Fidel. In Western-style Communism we would have to create an almost imaginary workers’ image of themselves as the father-figure.

&gt;RB: That’s a pretty cool idea – the Working Class becomes its own Hero. As long as it was not a new comforting illusion, as long as there was a real workers’ power. If a capitalist or bureaucrat is running your life then you need to compensate with illusions.

&gt;YO: The people have got to trust in themselves.

&gt;TA: That’s the vital point. The working class must be instilled with a feeling of confidence in itself. This can’t be done just by propaganda – the workers must move, take over their own factories and tell the capitalists to bugger off. This is what began to happen in May 1968 in France…the workers began to feel their own strength. 

&gt;JL: But the Communist Party wasn’t up to that, was it?

&gt;RB: No, they weren’t. With 10 million workers on strike they could have led one of those huge demonstrations that occurred in the centre of Paris into a massive occupation of all government buildings and installations, replacing de Gaulle with a new institution of popular power like the Commune or the original Soviets – that would have begun a real revolution but the French C.P. was scared of it. They preferred to deal at the top instead of encouraging the workers to take the initiative themselves… 

&gt;JL: Great, but there’s a problem about that here you know. All the revolutions have happened when a Fidel or Marx or Lenin or whatever, who were intellectuals, were able to get through to the workers. **They got a good pocket of people together and the workers seemed to understand that they were in a repressed state. They haven’t woken up yet here, they still believe that cars and tellies are the answer.** You should get these left-wing students out to talk with the workers, you should get the school-kids involved with The Red Mole.

Long live Lennonism!

[Reading the full article](http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm) where the quote is from is much more advisable. You can see how Che focuses on the philosophical and ethical aspects of Marxism, something I love greatly. He wasn't only an armed guerilla as many believe. He was also a brilliant thinker.

&gt; **Abstract**

&gt; An unpromising title, this, in the seventh year of the third millennium of the Common Era; rather like “Recent Developments in Ptolemaic Astronomy” or “Betamax—a Technology Whose Time Has Come.” My grandfather’s dream, the faith of my younger days, has turned to ashes. And yet, I remain persuaded that Karl Marx has something important to teach us about the world in which we live today. In what follows, I propose to take as my text a famous statement from Marx’s A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy—a sort of preliminary sketch of Das Kapital—and see what it can tell us about the capitalism of our day. I shall try to show you that Marx was fundamentally right about the direction in which capitalism would develop, but that because of his failure to anticipate three important features of the mature capitalist world, his optimism concerning the outcome of that development was misplaced. Along the way, I shall take a fruitful detour through the arid desert of financial accounting theory.

Never formally studied it or anything, but definitely I'd say browsing Wikipedia and learning about it, coming from a desire to know why things were the way they were, lead me to a worldview that led me to socialism.
-----==----==---==-----
Just finished a MA in sociology, my thesis attempts to determine the roots of Cuba's [agricultural transformation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TzvnRo6_c) since the Special Period and the relevance of these developments to Marxist thought/practice on agriculture. It'll be online eventually for those wanting to read it. 

Debating whether or not to go for the doctorate. I'd love to teach, but hate all of the petty backstabbing and hoop-jumping-through that academics tend to or are forced into engaging in. But also I'm feeling basically unemployable as it is, so the more brutal my job search becomes, the more appealing six more years of university will seem.
-----==----==---==-----
Personally, I like it because it's one of the only fields that encourages critically analyzing society, debunking what we think we know, and condemning social problems.

As Peter Berger said, by its nature sociology is "subversive of established patterns of traditional thought."
-----==----==---==-----
This is gonna sound sort of stereotypical, but taking two sociology classes in college really made me think about how the world works. It definitely made me lean left in my political beliefs. In those classes I learned about the real meaning of socialism (democratic control of the means of production by the working class) even though the books we read and the teacher came from a social democratic standpoint. We also learned about Karl Marx and I guess I agreed with a lot of his conclusions.

I was planning on majoring in sociology, since it was the only subject that really caught my attention and that I really liked, but I chose to go with computer science instead. (And to be honest, I'm still not positive on that).

I'm pretty sure a lot of sociologists lean left anyway. There was a sign outside my professor's door with the quote "Those who do not move, do not notice their chains", by Rosa Luxemburg.
-----==----==---==-----
You mean the branch of science that Karl Marx himself is considered one of the founders of? :D

hell yeah. Sociology major representing!
-----==----==---==-----
Currently writing my dissertation analyzing state market relations with a social ecology prospective. I believe statistics don't everything but neither does sociology. Sociology is a crucial component with our current struggles with the environment. 

I would suggest Murray bookchin. His ideas are a little unrealistic, but he uses sociology well.
-----==----==---==-----
While sociological study is what initially impelled my budding political radicalism, I discovered my personality ill-suited for conducting research mid-way through a PhD program.

Also, I'm a left-anarchist/libertarian socialist, if you for some reason don't wish to consider this "socialism". . .
-----==----==---==-----
Wow, this became much longer than i planned. Got a bit too engaged writing this. Hope some of you might read through it tough.
-----==----==---==-----
Welcome, comrade.  Glad to see another reject the trappings of social democracy.

It should really say "Venezuela expels **three** US officials", they haven't cleared out the embassies or anything quite so dramatic.

I've said it here before and I'll say it here again. Fuck John butthole Kerry. Here he is again, thinking he has some kind of credibility when it comes to Venezuela. It's even worse if he comes out with some kind of demands like he did last time. 
-----==----==---==-----
Long live the united venezuelan people against U.S imperialism !
-----==----==---==-----
&gt; US Secretary of State John Kerry criticised the Venezuelan government for arrests made during on-going opposition protests and violence, saying the actions “have a chilling effect on citizen’s rights to express their grievances peacefully.

Socialist International.

You can also get the music for The Internationale (was used as the national anthem of the Soviet Union until 1944, so there could be connotations you would want to avoid with it--regardless, it's generally seen as the socialist anthem), in red of course.

Right-wingers have taken Gramsci's concept of Cultural Hegemony, bastardized it, relabeled it, and then spun it into the perverse anti-communist propaganda term "Cultural Marxism". Libertarians and other right-wingers have also been appropriating a lot of terms and theories from Critical Theory as of late too. I have always likened right-wingers to the Orcs in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The Orcs, according to Tolkien, can only take technology/ideas/language from other races and then twist and deform them to serve their own dark ways. They cannot create anything independently, they can only distort, destroy, or defame the ideas of others. Of course Tolkien also based the Orcs off of right-wingers, specifically the Nazis, and his own fears of modern technology and it's capacity for destruction.

A couple years back fox news did a story on the 'British tea party' (the tax payers alliance), a relatively small organisation. To make them appear larger they misrepresented footage of left wing, anti cuts protests as tax payer alliance protests (which struggle to put a few hundred people o  the streets in reality)

Another big thing they stole from us: Orwell. 
-----==----==---==-----
Good propaganda is good propaganda.
-----==----==---==-----
National Socialism- to be obvious the use of the term socialism, but less obviously:

The name comes from a mistranslation of the phrase "national syndicalism", syndicalism being, at the time, an exclusively left-wing ideology involving, basically, trade union control of the economy. National syndicalism was an idea original to the right, based off of the premise of "corporations" or conglomerates of trade organizations and business and the state, essentially fascism. Fast forward to Hitler, and that term has been translated to German as "national socialism".

Also there's been quite a bit of the right grabbing anarchist aesthetics. National Anarchism is a thing and uses the traditional red-black bisected flag, with black being anarchism and red supposedly being nationalism. Some far-right groups, especially national anarchists, have used black bloc tactics.

[Appropriation of anarchist flag designs.](http://imgur.com/a/dVJsk)

Additionally there's the National Bolsheviks, or Nazbols, from Russia mostly, who claim to be syncretic with left-leaning economic ideals, but are politically nationalist. There's a notable faction within that ideology that is clearly racist and crypto-fascist, although a good chunk of the ideology seem to just be super-authoritarian Stalinists. Their flag is literally the nazi flag with a hammer and sickle.
-----==----==---==-----
The Falangists in the Spanish Civil War very openly appropriated anarchist aesthetics and even some rhetoric. 
-----==----==---==-----
Che Guevara, French revolutionaries, Stalin in Russia, Nelson Mandela, the entire 1848 Revolutions, ect...

Largely speaking, in France, the far-right is leeching on themes the left has abandonned.
-----==----==---==-----
there's lots of things, one example is the song Jerusalem which is sort of a second national anthem in the UK despite the fact that it's lyrics are from a poem by William Blake who was a radical, if not an early socialist (of course this depends on how you define left/right and socialist)

other examples include the Neo-Nazi appropriation of Antifa styles, slogans, images and tactics. Recently fascists, especially in Germany and Eastern Europe, have been using black bloc, they have also been appropriating some of the images that ANTIFA uses on stickers/posters and replacing the words etc.

also as someone else mentioned Orwell
If you want the precise theoretical analysis of this phenomenon I suggest you look into the interesting Situationist term [recuperation]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recuperation_%28politics%29), other examples include lots of the songs from the 1960s

-----==----==---==-----
The big one is obviously "freedom" and the way rightists claim to defend it, all while chipping away at it constantly.
-----==----==---==-----
Bitcoin already does this. There are also others like Litecoin that would also do that but are not as popular as Bitcoin.  It is decentralized and that is what makes it so revolutionary. There is no company or government that controls or issues Bitcoin.
-----==----==---==-----
Does it really matter that much? I'm skeptical about leftists who are being taken all by all the right-libertarian projects like cryptocurrency. None of these things change the underlying exploitative nature of capitalism.
-----==----==---==-----
To guy who posted a comment then downvoted - that's fine, but why did you delete it? you had some good points and it made me realise i had to make it clearer that I wanted to base it on BitCoin source dode, with the identity and community (as with dogecoin) as the defining feature.
-----==----==---==-----
I can't profess to understanding the technology behind crypto currency in anything more than a conceptual manner. However I'm very wary of them. I've heard some ways it might benefit those on the left but in reality they're a libertarian's wet dream. A currency that can't be traced and can be used to expertly avoid paying taxes.

IMO we should be looking to control banking by socialising it, not advocating technologies that will help the far right disproportionately.
-----==----==---==-----
I think cryptocurrency is great. I'm just hesitant about how they're valued and stability.
-----==----==---==-----
get a load of this reactionary analysis 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rprB_VNm3L8
-----==----==---==-----
Eh, it still had more of a liberal than a socialist slant, given that Lord Business was just 

**SPOILER WARNING** ~~a representation of the kid's father and his authoritarian and conformist regard to how he played with his legos, rather than any serious critique of capitalism or fascism~~ **END OF SPOILER**. 

The working class hero *was* a nice touch, but ultimately the story was freedom and creativity vs authoritarian conformity.
-----==----==---==-----
I've heard the movie had some of these elements in it (the anti capitalist sentiments, not the foreign policy/police state stuff)... Pretty interested to see if that really is the case.

Also, yknow. Lego.

&gt;The land is shown to be a world of happiness before they destroy it. That seems to be a reference to the American intervention in Afghanistan and the justification of searching for Al-queda.

That seems like a stretch. So does the Guantanamo thing... If it's even an allusion to anything at all, it'd probably be a more general reference to wars/imperialism.
-----==----==---==-----
Didn't read post. Guess I am going to see the movie now. Thanks for spoiler warning.
-----==----==---==-----
If it's alright with you I'm going to take one of the t's from "bitting" and add it to "ploters" :)

Relatively, yes, which says very little.
-----==----==---==-----
I agree with essentially everything you said.  I think this is a brilliant movie that is one of the best if not the best children's films I've seen in presenting a view of the world and people.  Right up there with The Brave Little Toaster for me.
-----==----==---==-----
Is there not also a parallel between the mind numbing Happy by [Pharrell Williams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Sxv-sUYtM&amp;feature=kp) and [Everything is Awesome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y)?
-----==----==---==-----
Jesus Christ. Is this all the left is now? Half-baked interpretations of the garbage put out by bourgeois media? 

Please, tell me more about how the fucking Lego Movie is a criticism of the economic system which developed it? Please explain how it's not a carefully crafted script meant to appeal to anyone and everyone watching it.


-----==----==---==-----
Top down control? Cultural homogeneity? Centralized ownership of the means of production?

Sounds like..the soviet union. or Cuba. or NK.

Fordism was the ideology of the new dealers.

-----==----==---==-----
They basically threatened their jobs. What the threat needed to be was that if VW closed the plant because there was a union, it would be illegal to sell VWs in the US. 
-----==----==---==-----
Things like Occupy Wall Street are popping up all over the world. In the next 100 years I do believe we'll have a revolution or another world war.
-----==----==---==-----
I think efforts will be focused on replacing the capitalist means with more democratic ones. I feel like the idea of a revolution is far fetched and subversion of current systems will be more effective.
-----==----==---==-----
We have been on the verge since 1900.  A revolution could likely occur at any point in many countries in the Middle East or Africa.  Sadly, these would probably go into some form of state capitalism, as they are typically undeveloped.  However, if this coincides with mass rioting, union strikes or whatever in a major Western nation, then these ideas will be more well spread.  Class consciousness is not a value that constantly increases: It experiences peaks, and has troughs between these points.

The current revolutions in Europe will likely result in at least one unstable socio-political situation (Ukraine looking more likely than Bosnia at this point).  And we all know what typically happens to transitional governments: there are waves of revolution, in quick succession.  Sometimes inner-party struggles, sometimes new parties take control.  But it depends on who takes control.  With Ukraine, it currently looks like fascists, and is very unlikely to ever switch to communists.
-----==----==---==-----
Whatever might eventually be called the class consciousness that would lead to a revolution would actually be simply the result of a critical mass of poverty having been reached. For this to happen in the US, it will still be a long time.
-----==----==---==-----
We can't even exist in one sub, without it being coopted by totalitarians.

Since there is so much propaganda and shilling happening, I figured I'd turn to the Diplomatic Cables which were leaked to wikileaks a few years ago.

http://cablegatesearch.wikileaks.org/search.php?q=Leopoldo+Lopez&amp;qo=20480&amp;qc=2&amp;qto=2010-02-28

This classified cable in particular goes into some of the backdoors politicking between the rightist Chavez opposition in Venezuela:[What's Wrong With The Opposition?](http://cablegatesearch.wikileaks.org/cable.php?id=09CARACAS1408&amp;q=leopoldo%20lopez) - basically, unity ticket, or not?
-----==----==---==-----
Odd. Why?
-----==----==---==-----
God damnit fudged liberal socialists. Stop trying to invent new classes. These people are middle-class (except for the army, but that's a whole different story).
-----==----==---==-----
Nope, there remains two classes: Proletariat and Bourgeoisie. Of course, there's different layers which can be defined.
-----==----==---==-----
Is there something fundamentally wrong with dividing the Proletariat into sub classes? Curious. Wouldnt it add more depth to the analysis? 
-----==----==---==-----
This is poor analysis and theory. The vast majority of police, military members, etc. come from the working class. They are, however, bought off by and serve the capitalist class. This makes them class traitors; running dogs of the bourgeoisie. 
-----==----==---==-----
We have an anti-imperialist obligation to half the planet....lets be honest. 
-----==----==---==-----
They're afraid because they know their money has been "earned" dishonestly.
-----==----==---==-----
The worst part of this is that the American proletariat have been fed so much propaganda that they would literally die for the right of the bourgeoisie to live this lifestyle. They would rather have a worse life than to live with the thought that the wealthy aren't making a profit. 
-----==----==---==-----
finally, some real journalism. good shit. it seems like most of those people were sociopaths or at the least, just terrible human beings. just as capitalism alienates workers from their labor, it alienates the elites from reality.
-----==----==---==-----
"Mulrow was dressed in raggedy, tie-dye clothes to play the part of a liberal radical, and Henry was playing the part of a wealthy baron." 

Talk about out of touch...their "liberal" is a 60's hippie concerned about jobs.

&gt; All told, enough wealth and power was concentrated in the St. Regis that night that if you had dropped a bomb on the roof, global finance as we know it might have ceased to exist.

&gt; But the extent of their worry wasn’t made clear until Ross offered himself up as a source for future stories in exchange for my cooperation.

&gt; “I’ll pick up the phone anytime, get you any help you need,” he said.

&gt; “Yeah, the people in this group could be very helpful,” Lebenthal chimed in. “If you could just keep their privacy in mind.”

Uhhh, no.  Fuck that.  These people need to have **all** of their privacy removed; unlisted phone numbers, unmarked limos, gated community addresses, office addresses, leak 'em all.
-----==----==---==-----
Is this attitude and behavior *really* not common knowledge by this point? How do people not know that this is what they act like?
-----==----==---==-----
"Their pursuit of money and power had removed them from the larger world to the sad extent that, now, in the primes of their careers, the only people with whom they could be truly themselves were a handful of other prominent financiers."

Boo-hoo... their money makes them friendless.  As if they have no choice. 
-----==----==---==-----
These social democrats cooperating with the SI seems to think they are the continuation of the youth wing of the Second International. They fall for the right wing lies about police violence in Venezuela. The same right wing that attempted a military coup supported by the US.

You call yourself "antichavista socialist". I am not an unconditional supporter of Chavez. But he lifted the country out of poverty, and drove out many american companies. I might not support him in all his policies. But i would not like the IUSY rather see the opposition win and spread lies about the Chavistas.
-----==----==---==-----
Well, it's been posted twice before, only the first time did it get any comments (neither or which invited any discussion but rather praised Wolff instead). I also assume a fair amount of us are subscribed to the channel and thus alerted when a new video is uploaded.

My excuse is that I have not had time to finish watching it. Any particular parts of the talk that would be worthwhile for discussion, in your opinion?
-----==----==---==-----
Looks pretty good. Of course, judging from the diction this was likely a very oral PowerPoint, but I'll assume you did a good job with your speaking.

I thought [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNDAovm9FNo) lecture was rather insightful.


Dr. William I. Robinson, "Global Capitalism &amp; the Crisis of Humanity," NCSGC, Sep 2011.


Dr. William I. Robinson, Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, gives a lecture titled "Global Capitalism and the Crisis of Humanity." Dr. Robinson is the author of numerous articles and books, with more information available here: http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/robinson/ This talk was given at the 1st conference of the Network for Critical Studies of Global Capitalism. The conference took place in Prague in the Czech Republic.

When roughly 80 people own half of the world's wealth.
-----==----==---==-----
Capitalism alleviates world poverty. Walmart, Nike, Coca Cola, and other corporations are why America has such a high standard of living. They employ thousands of people and satisfy demands. Refrerators, microwaves, light bulbs, washing machines, and other goods that give us such a high standard of living are the products of capitalism.

The third world is poor due to government corruption and intervention in the economy. William Easterly and Paul Thomas Bauer, two respected economists, have written extensively on how foreign aid supports failed government policies that hinder growth, like government ownership of natural resources.

India and China became far wealthier after they liberalized.
-----==----==---==-----
Selections from the article:

&gt;Since its inception, the United Nations has served primarily as an alliance of imperialist countries against the aspirations of the oppressed.

&gt;As a world body, it reflects the class character of the states that make it up and the balance of forces between the classes on a world scale.

&gt;...

&gt;The Security Council holds all the power in the United Nations. It is the body that votes to authorize the use of force, and it is the body that orders sanctions. It also oversees "peacekeeping operations."

&gt;If the Security Council does not take action on an issue, the issue dies. Likewise, if a permanent member vetoes a resolution, the resolution dies.

&gt;For example, the U.S. government has vetoed nearly 40 resolutions critical of Israeli crimes against the Palestinians. The United States, Britain and France also vetoed key resolutions condemning apartheid in South Africa for many years.

&gt;The only time that the Security Council has taken action in direct conflict with the interests of a permanent member was when U.S. troops led U.N. forces into the Korean War in 1950. 

&gt;...

&gt;The other main body of the United Nations is the General Assembly, the organization’s main forum for debate. It is the only U.N. body that includes representatives from all member countries. Each member country has one vote.

&gt;The General Assembly can issue recommendations, but it has no power to force countries to act. 

&gt;...

&gt;The magnitude of the problem can be seen in the U.N. resolutions against the U.S. blockade of Cuba. Despite 14 consecutive votes against the U.S. blockade—the last was 182 to 4 in November 2005—the General Assembly resolution is only symbolic. No U.N. body or affiliate has the power to enforce the resolution.

&gt;...

&gt;From its inception, the United Nations has generally done the imperialists’ bidding.

&gt;In 1947, it mandated the partitioning of historic Palestine, creating the state of Israel. Thousands of Palestinians were killed in the wake of that decision, and 850,000 more were forced off their land in a cruel instance of ethnic cleansing.

&gt;There are more than 6 million Palestinian refugees worldwide. There is a General Assembly resolution mandating the inalienable right to return to their homes and land, but it has never been acted upon in the Security Council.

&gt;The United Nations also has failed to condemn or take action against myriad imperialist, mainly U.S.-led, interventions against oppressed countries and peoples.

&gt;This has been especially true in Africa. In the 1960s, the United Nations was used by the imperialists as international cover to crush national liberation movements.

&gt;The CIA worked with U.N. forces stationed in the Congo to kidnap and murder the newly elected prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, in 1960.

&gt;The United Nations did nothing to stop the racist South African apartheid army and the U.S. CIA from invading Angola in the 1970s.

&gt;Overt intervention has been a hallmark of the United Nations—always in the interests of imperialism. Since its inception, the organization has intervened with "peacekeeping" missions more than 60 times.

&gt;In the late 1980s, U.N. ground forces disarmed Namibian liberation fighters while allowing South African apartheid forces to roam free, resulting in mass killings. Then, as the elections for independence occurred, U.N. and South African joint patrols terrorized the population.

&gt;More recently, in Haiti, the United Nations has provided international cover for what started as a U.S. coup and occupation. U.N. troops and fascist militias now terrorize the Haitian population.

&gt;Today, the U.S. government is pushing for "peacekeepers" in Sudan using the pretext of the internal conflict in Darfur. The history of U.N. "peacekeepers" in Africa should give progressive people pause before joining the State Department-led chorus.

&gt;...

&gt;Another tactic employed by the imperialists is the imposition of U.N.-mandated economic sanctions. But sanctions are war by a different name.

&gt;The most horrific example was the 13 years of U.S.-led, genocidal U.N. sanctions on Iraq. By the organization’s own estimates, U.N. sanctions killed more than 1 million Iraqis, half of them children under the age of five.

&gt;The sanctions and blockade on Iraq that preceded the U.S. invasion in 2003 were similar to those that targeted Yugoslavia in the 1990s and undermined the socialist federation. In that case also, sanctions paved the way for the U.S.-led NATO war that killed tens of thousands.

&gt;Sanctions have also been used against Panama, Libya, Angola, the Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Haiti and others.

&gt;Not once has the United Nations imposed any sanctions against an imperialist country or proxy in any meaningful way. Similarly, not once has the United Nations sent "peacekeeping" forces to oppose imperialist aggression anywhere in the world.

&gt;ALP Left

Implying there is a left in the ALP
-----==----==---==-----
There is an ALP Left; But in Melbourne at least there is very little open organisation and advocacy of socialist principles.  The rationale behind this is that the SL is a faction and not a party; but given so little discussion of socialism goes on in the ALP more broadly - unless we change this the Left in Victoria will slowly wither away I believe.  In NSW interestingly they have their own magazine at least.  We should do the same thing in Victoria. And annual conferences on ideas and policy as well.  I personally publish the 'ALP Socialist Left Forum' blog - but our readership is down from the past - and I need other ALP Lefties to get involved and contribute.
-----==----==---==-----
In any case the article doesn't talk about the ALP itself that much; and I just recommend comrades read it and make up their own minds what they think. :)

I can definitely give my second opinion to VLC as a media player, its actually vastly superior to any paid alternative.

I'm gonna leave this here: *The Debian Project* has no formal legal status. Not even a non profit or fundation (although technically SPI owns the trademark).

I use the free opensource OpenOffice instead of that crappy and expensive Microsoft Office crap. 

Is that the kind of thing the poster is referring to? because I can endorse that. 
-----==----==---==-----
Thanks for the amazing post! I wholeheartedly agree.

If anyone is looking to get a new OS, I've been quite happy with [Crunchbang](https://crunchbang.org); it's light and very easy to use, and doesn't have the security concerns that Ubuntu does.

Also, shoutout to the [OTR plugin](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) for Pidgin. The person with whom you are chatting also needs to have the plugin installed, but it's a very solid way to keep your chats secure.

The main downside I can think of for using a FLOSS OS is that Adobe no longer supports Flash for Linux beyond the 11.2 version. So if you watch a lot of online videos or play flash games, it may not work reliably for you, especially if you use Firefox. Don't let that dissuade you, though! The Chromium browser helps a lot.
-----==----==---==-----
I use ubuntu. It's faster and more reliable than windows. No viruses. More customizable. open source and free. if I was more hardcore i'd use a less "user friendly" linux distro. 

libreoffice instead of office

gimp instead of photoshop

vlc instead of whatever other video player there is (I don't actually know)

eclipse for all my programming

firefox obviously for browsing

qbittorrent for torrenting

calibre for ebook management

huh. those are the only programs I have. 
-----==----==---==-----
Whilst I us and contribute to open source and agree with it in general, there is a wider issue that free software brings attention to that socialists aren't ok with but that never gets attacked in a meaningful way; intellectual property.  The private ownership of the means of ideas. I often think about what this means  and I believe, on a fundamental level, that ideas mean nothing and labour means everything.

Think how useless coke would be if anyone could take their product, make the same recipe and use their branding/propaganda. The crisis would be existential; coke would no longer be the "real thing". When you think about it, why should the concept of coke be any more protected from communal ownership than the concept of pie or language. Intellectual property is fundamentally vague its this counter intuitive nature that gives capitalists a huge amount of power and creates unnecessary monolithic organisations.

There are no unique ideas, we depend on the ideas of others. Thinking your good idea  belongs to you is one thing, but thinking it gives you a right to profit from someone else's labour is abhorrent.

So It's not *just* open source software, it's open source ideas. Check out "open source ecology" for the kind of system I'm talking about and imagine open 3D printing systems shared by towns of people with no notion of ownership of an idea.
-----==----==---==-----
Is open source not communism in action, in a sense?
-----==----==---==-----
I've been using free software since the time that I was a teenager, which is also around the time I got interested in leftism. Free software has great philosophical underpinnings, and understanding the role that software and intellectual property in general play in the economic and social systems of today is vital to anyone who wants to affect change in society.

Currently I use a variety of free and non-free software, but I believe in Stallman's prediction that free software is an essential aspect of personal freedom. Software that isn't free will inevitably be used to control its users or subject them to authority, whether corporate or governmental.

Linux is by far the most cutting edge and powerful free operating system, but I am also a strong proponent and user of FreeBSD. BSD evolved out of the original Unix system, and it and its descendants have been massively influential over all software. BSD's modern day incarnations are the products of superb engineering.

As far as Linux distros go I use Fedora. I've been using it regularly for the past ten years. It never fails to impress me with its professional quality.

It's important to move away from proprietary packages and lend support to free and open source software—and I'm a strong advocate for public sector and government organisations doing the same. It's software developed for the communal good versus software developed for profit; that's communism in action!

Great post!  One thing's missing though:

CP from myself:

&gt; (s)SIP is an opensource voip-protocol to setup secure audio streams between people over internet. It's simple to use and reasonably secure against most forms of surveillance.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Goto [ostel.co](https://ostel.co/) and make an account there
&gt; 2. Download [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) (Linux/Mac/Windows) and [CSsipsimple](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csipsimple) on Andoid
&gt; 3. Log in on your client and set ostel.co on port 5061 as outboundproxy.
&gt; 4. Set zRTP to mandatory and make sure to use TLS as transport signaling protocol.
&gt;

&gt; [ Why you should use ZRTP](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/11/lets-talk-about-zrtp.html)


NEVER EVER be tempted to use Skype. If all your friends use Skype, make them aware of Sip. Skype is the equivalent of standing on a public square, crowded with people whilst trying to have a private conversation over a megaphone whilst everyone is holding audiorecorders ready to upload every bit of talk to every corner of the internet. 

Fuck Skype. NEVER use it.

If you're looking for great security as well, check out keepass and tor browser. I dont have links for them on my phone but they can be found with a quick Google search. 

Keepass generates super secure passwords generated and stored in a password database stored where you want it. This database can be secured with a key file and or a password. 

Tor routes your network traffic all around the world to make your network footprint virtually invisible. Only caveat is that anything that relies on ip addressing to verify security (like banks) won't like that you're using it, since it will appear Youre moving across the planet each time you navigate somewhere else. 

Edit: I'll add that, for you pc gamers out there, steam runs on Linux as do all valve games. More and more games are becoming available on Linux and the indie community especially loves it.

gates' and jobs' legacy to the world of computing will ultimately be that they saw the new and vastly powerful commons of internet technology emerging and they built a fence around it, claimed it as their own, and sold it back to the people who it rightfully belonged to.

soon, most software will be in clouds, with you renting some time with photoshop, word etc. how will that affect the people and their awareness of free software?
-----==----==---==-----
Well, one problem I can see here is that some people are just used to some kinds of software and refuse to move to anything else.  
  
I've recommended using OpenOffice and LibreOffice to quite a few people but all said its too "hard", whatever that may mean. They've all been taught to use Windows and MSOffice in schools, they've all had that on their home computers since they were kids, its a familiarity they just can't leave behind or find it wasteful to find the time to learn it all again (which really isn't the case).  
  
I would rather propose a change in how children are taught to use computers and software in general, not be taught how to use Windows and Office specifically.  
  
Promoting use of open source software is definitely an easier start in this regard.

-----==----==---==-----
I use all of that software as a matter of course :) , I like to support the kind of people who dedicate such time and resources for the good of everyone. If only a large computer manufacturer such as HP, ASUS etc would adopt it as standard, then by proxy a lot more software would be written as Linux compatible!
-----==----==---==-----
Free software, HOOAH!
-----==----==---==-----
I am a huge fan of open source, but as a software engineer myself I see no harm in an honest pay for an honest days work. It's not like proprietary software is inherently evil. Just putting it from the perspective of a developer.

My computer has been running free software for about 8 months now, and I can say it's just as good as that nonfree software from Microsoft and Apple. The only nonfree software on my computer is Steam, to download games I already owned, although I am also giving the free games a try, and I am currently working on learning to program.

Also, as an FYI I would reccomend against anything based on Ubuntu, including Ubuntu itself, read these three posts to see why:
http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1hklfs/why_is_there_so_much_hate_on_ubuntu_lately/
http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1hklfs/why_is_there_so_much_hate_on_ubuntu_lately/cavf7by
http://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/1hklfs/why_is_there_so_much_hate_on_ubuntu_lately/cavf74a
Or a basic summary: Year after year, Ubuntu contains more nonfree software. Ubuntu is not looking to "free" computers, they are looking to form another monopoly, in the name of "freedom".*

My computer currently runs Debian GNU/Linux without any of the nonfree and contrib software, but if you want to take it to a more extreme by not even having any of that nonfree stuff hiding in the repositories:
https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html

I also just started learning to write computer software last weekend, after which I plan to contribute to free software projects.

Edit: *Maybe Trisquel is an exception, it is based on Ubuntu, but filters out all the nonfree software, and then hosts it's own repositories, or update servers, restoring the freedoms GNU/Linux provides: https://trisquel.info/

Socialists do not want a freedom from ideas, or a freedom to. We want a freedom from class, free software does not give us this.
-----==----==---==-----
Gimp is pretty cool. Adobe now releases Elements for free, however- so I'm going to play around with it. I have windows 8.1 (growl) on my computer as my main system, although I have Ubuntu installed and plan on switching most of the computer's functionality over to that once I finally dedicate myself to learning more how to use it. Does Google have an operating system that can be installed onto a PC?
-----==----==---==-----
One of the problems with free software is accountability if something goes wrong. Imagine there is an aircraft running open source software. Software glitches and the thing crashes and burns, killing everyone. Now who are you going to hold accountable? Some college student who wrote the part of it that malfunctioned?

The second problem is support. Buying a software product is not just paying the engineers, it is paying for technical support that comes with it. While development of software can be *free*, done by enthusiasts, or open-sourced after being developed for some commercial purpose, providing reliable support for it is problematic. Distros like Red Hat have both free and commercial versions for this purpose. Free software does not come with a warranty. Support can never be 100% free.

As someone hoping to get into teaching in the next couple of years here in the UK, this is indeed worrying. The same process is being followed, cut funding and let 'acadamy' schools go the way of business and the market. 

More tests, less teachers, less teaching.

Preliminary to the discussion of his findings, I want to point out that there are a number of problems in the way Borsch-Supan goes about establishing whether the employment effect of a reduction in hours of labor predominates over improving the productive power of social labor. First and foremost among these problems is the value blindspot of the bourgeois simpleton economist. For the economists all paid labor has value in the tautological sense: by definition the exchange value of a commodity is its price. Thus virgin land, if it is sold in the market, has value equal to its price, although no human labor has been expended producing it. This presents a problem when it comes to calculating the impact of reduced hours of labor, however.
-----==----==---==-----
Those estimates of superfluous labor time really make it hard to swallow this piece even though they're not necessary to follow the argument. Worker productivity has been tracking upwards for decades so I'm astounded to hear anyone estimate that 36 hours out of every 40 hour work week are superfluous. 

And if we're to view this as a bubble that must inevitably burst, timing becomes an important question. We're supposed to burst bubbles during booms, and I don't think many would argue labor is booming right now. 

Maybe I haven't understood.

[Text of the full speech](http://www.infoplease.com/t/hist/state-of-the-union/73.html)  
  
Another relevant speech by Lincoln is his [Address before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Address_before_the_Wisconsin_State_Agricultural_Society):   
  
&gt;The world is agreed that labor is the source from which human wants are mainly supplied. There is no dispute upon this point. From this point, however, men immediately diverge. Much disputation is maintained as to the best way of applying and controlling the labor element. By some it is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital -- that nobody labors, unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow, by the use of that capital, induces him to do it. Having assumed this, they proceed to consider whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent; or buy them, and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so far they naturally conclude that all laborers are necessarily either hired laborers, or slaves. They further assume that whoever is once a hired laborer, is fatally fixed in that condition for life; and thence again that his condition is as bad as, or worse than that of a slave. This is the "mud-sill" theory.  

&gt;But another class of reasoners hold the opinion that there is no such relation between capital and labor, as assumed; and that there is no such thing as a freeman being fatally fixed for life, in the condition of a hired laborer, that both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them groundless. They hold that labor is prior to, and independent of, capital; that, in fact, capital is the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed -- that labor can exist without capital, but that capital could never have existed without labor. Hence they hold that labor is the superior -- greatly the superior -- of capital.  

&gt;They do not deny that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital. The error, as they hold, is in assuming that the whole labor of the world exists within that relation. A few men own capital; and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their capital, hire, or buy, another few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class -- neither work for others, nor have others working for them. Even in all our slave States, except South Carolina, a majority of the whole people of all colors, are neither slaves nor masters. In these Free States, a large majority are neither hirers or hired. Men, with their families -- wives, sons and daughters -- work for themselves, on their farms, in their houses and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hirelings or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital; that is, labor with their own hands, and also buy slaves or hire freemen to labor for them; but this is only a mixed, and not a distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class. Again, as has already been said, the opponents of the "mud-sill" theory insist that there is not, of necessity, any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life. There is demonstration for saying this. Many independent men, in this assembly, doubtless a few years ago were hired laborers. And their case is almost if not quite the general rule.  

&gt;The prudent, penniless beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land, for himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This, say its advocates, is free labor -- the just and generous, and prosperous system, which opens the way for all -- gives hope to all, and energy, and progress, and improvement of condition to all. If any continue through life in the condition of the hired laborer, it is not the fault of the system, but because of either a dependent nature which prefers it, or improvidence, folly, or singular misfortune. I have said this much about the elements of labor generally, as introductory to the consideration of a new phase which that element is in process of assuming. The old general rule was that educated people did not perform manual labor. They managed to eat their bread, leaving the toil of producing it to the uneducated. This was not an insupportable evil to the working bees, so long as the class of drones remained very small. But now, especially in these free States, nearly all are educated -- quite too nearly all, to leave the labor of the uneducated, in any wise adequate to the support of the whole. It follows from this that henceforth educated people must labor. Otherwise, education itself would become a positive and intolerable evil. No country can sustain, in idleness, more than a small per centage of its numbers. The great majority must labor at something productive. From these premises the problem springs, "How can labor and education be the most satisfactory combined?"   

&gt;By the "mud-sill" theory it is assumed that labor and education are incompatible; and any practical combination of them impossible. According to that theory, a blind horse upon a tread-mill, is a perfect illustration of what a laborer should be -- all the better for being blind, that he could not tread out of place, or kick understandingly. According to that theory, the education of laborers, is not only useless, but pernicious, and dangerous. In fact, it is, in some sort, deemed a misfortune that laborers should have heads at all. Those same heads are regarded as explosive materials, only to be safely kept in damp places, as far as possible from that peculiar sort of fire which ignites them. A Yankee who could invent strong handed man without a head would receive the everlasting gratitude of the "mud-sill" advocates.   

&gt;But Free Labor says "no!" Free Labor argues that, as the Author of man makes every individual with one head and one pair of hands, it was probably intended that heads and hands should cooperate as friends; and that that particular head, should direct and control that particular pair of hands. As each man has one mouth to be fed, and one pair of hands to furnish food, it was probably intended that that particular pair of hands should feed that particular mouth -- that each head is the natural guardian, director, and protector of the hands and mouth inseparably connected with it; and that being so, every head should be cultivated, and improved, by whatever will add to its capacity for performing its charge. In one word Free Labor insists on universal education.

What economic failure?

Check out the [Bolivarian Missions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_Missions):

&gt;&gt;The "Bolivarian Missions" have entailed the launching of government anti-poverty initiatives,[1] the construction of thousands of free medical clinics for the poor,[2] the institution of educational campaigns that have reportedly made more than one million adult Venezuelans literate,[3] and the enactment of food[4] and housing subsidies.[5] The infant mortality rate fell by 18.2% between 1998 and 2006.[6][7] The government earmarked 44.6% of the 2007 budget for social investment, with 1999-2007 averaging 12.8% of GDP.[8] The Gini coefficient has fallen from 48.7 in 1998 to 42 in 2007 (claims that the Gini has risen were based on data from two different (non-comparable) statistical series).[9] **During the Chávez Presidency, poverty and extreme poverty have gone down strongly: poverty fell from 59.4% in 1999 to 30.2% in 2006 and extreme poverty went down from 21.7% to 9.9% in the same period.** Even critics like Instituto Real Elcano from Spain acknowledge these achievements although they cast doubts on the sustainability of these policies.[10]

What data are you using to decide that Venezuela is an "economic failure"? If Venezuela is an economic failure because of its severe reductions in poverty, malnutrition, and mortaility, then I hope every country in the world also faces this economic failure!
-----==----==---==-----
It’s really funny to see people defending the venezuelan government without having the slightest clue of what is going on here.
Search for the every weekend deaths in Venezuela (especially Caracas, the capital), product of insecurity. There are more innocent deaths every weekend than in warzones.
We have one of the biggest oil reserves in the world; yet, inflation in Venezuela is never under 20% every year. 
In 14 years of “revolution” the Venezuelan currency (bolivar) has devaluated almost 1000%, using a lame currency control to hide this fact that has only been used for more corruption.
If you ever made public that you do not support the government you can forget about working in any public facility (I have been rejected for this reason 3 times from working in PDVSA)
The expropriations of working companies, just to see them disappear and never work again. As Exito (big department stores chain, now called bicentenario supermarkets, and PDVAL ,lost tons of food that got rotten because they were hoarding it to blame the “capitalist right”)
The lack of transparency in election processes like the last presidential, where they never allowed to make a full audit about it even when the so called winning difference was very small. (talk about democracy).
The constant violations of human rights (I’m not gonna extend to much on this point now, just look for the THOUSANDS of evidence of it online)
There is political persecution everywhere.
There is evidence of the own government arming paramilitary groups to shoot to kill opposition peaceful protests called “colectivos”.
These paramilitary groups have been around for years. Being paid to repress anyone who doesn’t agree with government politics
Minimum wage is around 40$ a month really (1$ costs 86 bolivars really, not 12.6 Bs as the government says because it’s IMPOSSIBLE to get dollars at that price)
The missions barely work, the CDI (the so called “thousands” of built hospitals by the government barely work because of the lack of medicine and medical supplies.
I could keep going, but I’m out to protest, it’s my legal right established in the constitution, article 68, where it also forbids the use of chemical substances or firearms to control the manifestations, but you can see that there are more than 20 death people and hundreds of injured people (opposition protesters).
So my dear socialist friend, the socialist theory is beautiful. But it’s not what we live every day in Venezuela where venturing going out of your house to study or work, might be your last walk on earth because of insecurity. 

-----==----==---==-----
[Venezuela is NOT a socialist country.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_socialist_countries) They are supposed to be preparing to enter a transition period which will eventually end with the implementation of socialism. but as of right now, they aren't even really close to being there.

If the socialist party loses the next election then all of the reforms will be rolled back. In 2013 they barely won because, apparently, chavez had a lot more weight with voters than the Party itself. This leads me to believe that future elections may not result in socialist victories.
-----==----==---==-----
But anyway Venezuelas problems are mostly because of sabotage by the wealthy elite, who own most of the businesses. Theyre causing economic problems to get rid of Maduro. 
-----==----==---==-----
Venzeula is trasitioning to socialism, a few years back 12% of industry was co-operatives, I suspect that has increased, co-operative ownership therefore is fairly signifcant in Venzeula. They have around 200 autonomous communes, set up with the support of the goverment, representing common ownership. Nearly 20000 communal councils have been set up, which allow communities to control the founds in their area via particpatory democracy, this you could class as communal ownership. Some enterprises taken over from the state, are run with workers self-management, this being a form of Democratic public ownership which some consider sociaism. So yes, there is still a lot of capitalist enterprises and state ownership, but enough social ownership to really scare the powerful. 
-----==----==---==-----
Venezuela has made strides in improving civil infrastructure, fighting poverty and illiteracy, demonstrating cooperative or community-based organization and has been one of the loudest voices against imperialism worldwide. 

That's why people support Venezuela. Those things don't make 'socialism' so much as they make a more egalitarian society. But the stated goal is to phase into socialism, gradually and democratically. Property rights and social relations haven't been subject to any serious challenge or analysis there.

Capitalist-supporters argue; 'see, this is what happens when you try to beat the system...'

But if you look to any other major societal change or revolution of any sort all throughout history, there's generally some upheaval and hard times. That's rough. But it's not a good reason to abandon your efforts entirely. 

Anyway, everything doesn't boil down to ideology. Venezuela is subject to material conditions as much as anyone else. They're not on favorable terms with the wealthier countries when it comes to trading. I believe Argentina's inflation rate has been much higher than Venezuela's for well over a decade now, and basic goods shortages aren't entirely uncommon in that part of the world. Unfortunately there's no easy way to overcome those problems in the global-market system. 

In the mean time you should continue to support Venezuela because they're trying to do something about it. 
-----==----==---==-----
the word socialist can be used to describe a country that is in the process of working towards the end goal of socialism, or a country that has achieved that end goal. venezuela is the former. nobody said the transition was going to be easy.
-----==----==---==-----
While I agree that Venezuela is not socialist, and that it needs a workers revolution, that doesn't mean that the government there hasn't done good thing for the people.
-----==----==---==-----
Its State Socialism. 

Which doesnt work. And isnt real socialism. 

Its like Anarcho-Capitalism = The two words together make NO SENSE and are contradictory. 
-----==----==---==-----
It is pre socialist. It is on its way to socialism. But it isn't socialist yet. It is much like Scandanavia, but we defend it because it is on its way to socialism.

But if he thinks De Blasio type liberals, especially considering how damn few there are like him (Not supporting De Blasio here, im just pointing out that his rhetoric is a bit farther left than most liberals.

Providing free higher education will allow the population to be more skilled/intellectual, and having high wages and workers control will encourage skilled/intellectual workers to come to the US. (When I say intellectual I don't mean IQ, unskilled workers have just as much of a capacity to be intellectual, I mean the work in itself is intellectual.)

A basic guaranteed income for all people goes a long way towards decreasing the suffering caused by inequality. This, with a national Kindergarten through College education system to even out the inequalities in school systems, increased taxes on wealth accumulations and inheritance, and increased unionization, are a good way to begin to correct the problem.

&gt;If it is to succeed, “Liberation theology” has to change in an Islamic context, because Muslim theology arguably does not exist. Theology is a fundamentally Christian concept that was born mainly from the recorded decrees of the Catholic Church as an institutional authority. There was a unity to its voice that made the body of writings known as “theology” possible.

wtf is this garbage?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_theology

This "Muslim theology does not exist" line would be news to the hundreds of Islamic theologians throughout history.

This is a line of garbage in paragraphs of garbage.

BTW, talking about "red Islam" with no mention of [Ali Shariati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Shariati)?

There is no need for "Libertation Theology for Muslims". What Muslims need is Marxism, as does anyone, no matter what their religious or irreligious background.
-----==----==---==-----
It is worth noting that the very first friendly group to greet foreign troops in the streets of Baghdad was an organization of communist students.  Because of his peculiar fascination with Stalin, Saddam Hussein tolerated a little bit of unorthodoxy among ivory tower groups committed to Marxist ideals.  I recall actually laughing out loud as I flipped form one anchor to another when this was actually happening.  The bright red flag they cheerfully waved confirmed what I suspected about their identity.  Most Western minds simply could not process the moment, and nearly all who saw it have since forgotten.  Some news channels cut away from the sight as soon as communist affiliation was suspected.  Others pretended to be confused or uncertain about the nature of the group first to welcome American troops as liberators.

Of course, that warm welcome was never a universal Iraqi sentiment, and soon the ineptitude of occupying authority would divide the country into two groups -- those unrelentingly hostile to the U.S. government, and those who took their pay from U.S. sources.  However, this all comes to mind, because I believe the phenomenon of organized communists as an enduring presence inside Hussein's Iraq provides evidence that Islam can be harmonized with Marxism, at least to some degree.  I believe that religion tends to obstruct progress far more often than it fosters progress, and certainly the idea that a body of ideas was taken from Christianity is not going to make it easier to popularize in the Muslim world.  However, Islam has some features that harmonize with sensible social philosophy, like hostility toward usury and a high value on hospitality.  
-----==----==---==-----
It didnt catch on in Afghanistan, I dont see why communism would catch on in any other muslim country. 

Or at least, if it did it wouldnt be any more communist than Egyptian president Gamal Abdul Nasser's Arab socialism (I like Nasser, but he was hardly a socialist, just an Arab Nationalist and anti-imperialist. Not that theres anything wrong with either of those things). 

And we know how Arab Socialism ended: It ended up degenerating into DEFINITELY NOT SOCIALIST Baath Party dudes like Saddam Hussein. Or the Assads. Regardless of ones opinions on the assads, theyre definitely not socialist. (by Assads instead of Assad, I mean both the current Bashar Al Assad and his father, Hafez Al Assad). 

But again I want to say I have the utmost respect for Nasser. He got the Canal back from British Imperialists, among other things. Best Egyptian leader since the original Mohammed Ali (not the boxer)

Islam cannot be communist or socialist because of its treatment of women.

I think the repression of women is such a central part of Islamic cultures because Islam allows certain behaviors that are anathema to women: that a man can have 4 wives; that he can divorce merely by saying "I divorce you" three times; and that a man can also have sex with as many other women as he can capture, enslave or buy (What Mohammed called "Women who thy right hand possess".). How do you make women accept those things when even Mohammed's wives had a problem with them? How do you make women acquiesces instead of running away, keep them faithful to men they don't want instead of putting out for the next attractive man they encounter? How do you MAKE them stand it? To MAKE them endure such practices, it is necessary to be incredibly brutal with them, and so Islamic cultures are. It is very similar to how pre-communist China treated women. They had no rights, could be sold into slavery or prostitution by their fathers, men who could afford it had multiple wives and concubines, and women had no real power, not even the power to make a living. In China, to prevent women from effectively resisting such practices, foot binding became the norm. First it was a practical matter to keep women from running away, then the feet were sexualized. It also became a status symbol because a man who could afford to keep a woman or women who could not work to help support the family was clearly a more affluent man than one who's women worked in the fields. Eventually foot binding became the norm for much of China's women.

The repression and subjugation of women is necessary because of polygamy and concubinage. But polygamous cultures must also be very harsh with men. There are 104 males born for every 100 females. So, from the start, for every man who has 2 wives, there must be one man who has none. For every man with four wives, there must be 3 men with none. For every man with 20,000 concubines, there must be 19,999 men with no wife. Islam fed these men into the Islamic armies and for centuries the Islamic invasions continued. A muslim soldier was allowed to keep 80% of everything he stole, of every individual he enslaved. So a successful soldier would return with female slaves or enough money to buy a female slave. In the western slave trade, 2/3s of those enslaved were males enslaved for their labor. In Islam 2/3s of those enslaved were women, enslaved to be sex slaves and brood males. 

But this is typical of polygamy. The Fundamentalist LDS are a small polygamous sect, not 100 years old. To get women to tolerate polygamy, they are kept subjugated and brainwashed. But the boys are also treated badly. For the old men to be able to marry many women, they have to get rid of the young boys, and do. This sect has about 10,000 members. In five years 400 boys between 12 and 21 were expelled along with a few rebellious girls. In 10 years it is estimated that 1000 young people, mostly boys, were expelled. This is typical of polygamous societies. 

A important part of socialism and communism is the liberation, the equality of women. And a polygamous society can never tolerate that and survive. So Islam can never be socialist or communist.

Big problem with Islam and a major reason for its lack of "progressiveness" or change. To put this in context, Islam is a "way of life" so it means that many Muslims are against change in all sorts of matters in reference to how people should live. In Islam, matters of religion cover most aspect of people's lives, which makes this sort of concept a concept which is very preserving of Islamic conservatism and not just preserving but regressing progress. Hence why Islamic countries actually regressed from where they were in the 50s, 60s, 70s to where they are today. They are attempting to capture some golden measure.

This is a great intro to Marxism. It's short and written in clear and modern language. Next time someone asks me why I'm a Marxist I'll send them this.

It's not quite that simple. If you just look at the numbers of violent crime rates in the US, they did not change significantly during the Reagan admin and they have gone down since. The incarceration rate, however, started to go way up. Funny how in the era of 'limited government', the prison state has grown tremendously.

The level of misinformation is depressing, because what we are taught is socialism isn't even close to socialism.

It's also depressing that the American left is associated with socialism, because it isn't even close to socialism.

but what's most depressing is that *the American Left isn't even close to socialism.*
-----==----==---==-----
The number of times I've heard "socialism is a good idea on paper" from people who have never bothered to look at it on paper is too large.
-----==----==---==-----
American Marxist-Leninist here.

Even my own mother, a very staunch progressive, thinks socialism is death camps, no rights, and Stalin. It was her that ultimately led me to adopt these views, and she thinks it "goes against human nature"

Yeah, it does depress me that people are so quick to accept what they hear as truth without investigating
-----==----==---==-----
The people who associate Obama, who himself praised "free enterprise", with socialism think its just about "taking other peoples money" and they have no mention of workers control over the means of production. They're just chanting what they heard on some conservatives youtube rant or on infowars.  One self professed Ron Paul follower I know called him a "dictator". While he has helped perpetuate the erosion of civil liberties, is indebted to the financial elite, and is continuing acts of terror in other parts of the world I wouldn't really use that word. But you know when someone promises to legalize pot and #endthefed people are willing to regurgitate stuff like that. All in all they're just using it as a bad word because they lack a real substantial argument. 
-----==----==---==-----
Yes, whenever I make the mistake of letting some know I'm socialist I get (In order of frequency)

Why do you hate my freedom?

So you like Hitler then?

Why are you in America?

So I'm guessing you like Obama then?

The Hitler comparison make me lose my shit, if you want to hate on socialism at least get your tyrant right.
-----==----==---==-----
It doesn't depress me, if everyone understood Socialism and rejected it, that would be depressing. I see the opportunity as a way to spread the word and gain a comrade or two.

My antagonizing Nietzsche-fan of a "friend" (he is the most ego-centric, thick skulled, and bullshitting person I know, but his mom's an English teacher and his dad's a bank executive from Czechoslovakia, so he must know best) rallied support with these quotes:

"Capitalism means progress. CEOs are the ones who invent--that's why they invent"

"That's what capitalism means: free market"

"The Paris Commune was a failure. You can't use that as an example.
[I inform him they were all executed]
Well, why couldn't they just leave Paris?
[I tell him they were encircled]
Well if they had actual strategic thinkers they could have known to leave Paris. Did they even have an army?" (That one was strangely popular for his side)

"Well ask my dad, Czechoslovakia was awful.
[I tell him Marxist-Leninism is not the same as Marxism]
Ha, Marxist-Leninism and Marxism? Why do you think scholars chose that name?
[I tell him Stalin was the one who came up with the term]
Yeah right, then why isn't it 'Marxist-Stalinism'?"

"Well take a look at my dad. If capitalism wasn't right, then how did he go from 0 money to bank executive?"

"We're at a school of the arts. The only people here are the bourgeois, because they turn to the arts first.
[It's a public school, and my very working class ex-girlfriend was sitting right next to him, along with someone I know is homeless]

"No one says 'It looks good on paper'."
I don't know what fucked up delusions he has that he doesn't remember someone saying that, but he really believes that no one does.

And this fucker is considered one of the smartest kids in the god damn school.
-----==----==---==-----
Honestly, I feel that I can write those people off because of how ludicrously uninformed they are in general. People who are otherwise well-educated in politics but think of socialism as Scandinavian social democracy are the ones who really depress me.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't find it depressing, but sometimes annoying.  Mainly because not only are we blatantly lied to about what socialism is, and also because of stereotypes associated with socialism.  One stereotype is that socialists are hippy types (not to insult hippies, I just don't fit the definition) and the other stereotype is that socialists are soviet styled stalinists or something.  What's also absurd is that both the american right, AND the american "left" have very inaccurate ideas of what socialism is (Bernie Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist, even though he's nothing more than a progressive liberal).
-----==----==---==-----
As a Canadian somewhere-between-social-democrat-and-democratic-socialist living in the US for the last five years, it drives me nuts.  I've gotten to the point where I have a kind of standard little rant ready for use on any occasion.

Example: Most of the people I go to church with are very right-wing, often even Tea-Party-ish in terms of their beliefs.  My motorcycle's been under repair for a while (finishing the fix today on the holiday), so I've occasionally carpooled to work with such a fellow congregant.  One day, our conversation drifted to him saying "Obama's such a socialist!"  I brought out my rant.^1

&gt; Obama is **not** a socialist.  Trust me.  **I'm** a socialist.^2  I belong to [a socialist political party back in Canada.^3](http://www.ndp.ca)  I've served on district executives of that party.  I've discussed, debated, and argued policy with socialists late into many nights.  I **know** what socialism is.^4  Trust me, Obama isn't even **close** to being a socialist!

I didn't rage and scream, I just spoke firmly with conviction.  He probably doesn't like Obama any more than he did before, but at least he's got a slightly less inaccurate perception of socialism than he did before.

Footnotes: ^1 Yeah, I've probably posted this rant here before.

^2 Yeah, many here would consider me *not* to be a "real" socialist.  But on the US spectrum, I'm still pretty far out there.  I tell Democrats "Hell, **Obama's** even too corporatist for me, not to mention Hillary," and I mean it.

^3 Yeah, many here would think the same about the NDP as they would about me, but again, by American standards....

^4 I'm certainly not as "up" on the subject as many here, but again, I've got a more accurate idea of what socialism is and isn't than probably 95% of Americans.
-----==----==---==-----
It doesn't depress me. It's just more fuel for the fire.
-----==----==---==-----
Its an opportunity to educate which is welcomed. It just annoys me that people will spend so much time arguing against something all the while not knowing anything about it.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm a fascist and it disappoints me. If you're gonna have a problem with an ideology, at least know why you hate it rather than just using it's name as a general slur or insult. Unfortunately we know this all too well. 
-----==----==---==-----
People associating it with Obama doesn't bother me that much. Yeah, it's ludicrous and thinking people don't buy it, but on the surface, at least, he looks like he's trying to help people and that's insanely popular among the masses (most of which don't have much money). It's a lie, of course, but he at least represents the *vague* idea of what our politics should be rather than the president constantly telling people that it's their fault if you're poor and that no one should feel sorry for you. If people get disgruntled and disenchanted in Obama, they're probably not going to move to the right; they're going to move to the left and criticize him (and the rest of the system) from there. When this generation of young people grows up, they're going to have a different level of expectation from their government. I don't think they'll be satisfied with a banal faux-Leftist. They'll want the real thing.

Rural and suburban white Southerners were never going to give him (or socialists) a chance. This country will only progress *in spite of* them. I believe in the power of urbanization to push people to the Left and this country (particularly the South) is undergoing a lot of urbanization right now. [My generation](/r/lostgeneration) (the Millennials) will be responsible for the largest urbanization effort in this country since the Gilded Age.

I also think "depression" is an unhealthy and largely false concept. People use 'depress' as a synonym for 'sadden', but I wish they'd use the latter word instead. "Depression" is largely a mentality peddled to Americans to sell dangerous designer drugs and keep them down and blaming the wrong things for their misery ("It's all in your head, it's not the outside world"). I prefer 'demoralize' because it's actually, you know, a real thing.
-----==----==---==-----

Notice the lack of [outrage](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/02/venezuela-land-rights-chavez-farmers) about the [ongoing murders](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/10293) of peasant farmers by rich, counter-revolutionary landlords attempting to block the agrarian reform.

One can also notice that none of the pro-opposition posters seem to be able to take either a historical or global view of the problems within their own nation. Nobody will deny Venezuela has a very severe inflation problem, but the narrative we are receiving, that things started to break down only once a socialist party assumed control of the government and directed oil revenues to the historically oppressed and excluded majority of working class Venezuelans. It is a structural problem with Venezuela's economy, as an underdeveloped oil-exporter, that has historical roots going back decades. In 1996, inflation rose above 99%, while GDP per capital was (adjusted) on par with 1963. As one Venezuelan writer [comments:](http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/10029) 

&gt; 7. In our country the problem of prices didn’t start fourteen years ago. And in honour of the truth it also didn’t start with the Adecos or Puntofijismo, but rather it forms part of an intrinsic characteristic of the type of capitalism that had developed with the arrival of petroleum. What that means in general terms is that the Venezuelan capitalist economy has been characterised during its history by high prices, which has translated in historically high rates of accumulation and unequal distribution of income.

One could add, to the structural roots of the inflation problem in the dis-articulation of economy in a peripheral petro-state, that the inflation problem is also greatly exacerbated by [capitalist speculatory hoarding and capital strikes](http://links.org.au/node/3705) directly designed to inflict economic damage, as happened in Allende's Chile for example. 

&gt; Between 2008 and 2013, public discourse has been punctuated by regular discoveries of colossal food hoards, followed by expropriations and expansion of the state food network. In March 2009, the Venezuelan government nationalised Cargill’s rice-processing plant after it found 18,000 tonnes of rice hoarded in its warehouses. In October 2010, the government followed its expropriation of aluminium and cardboard food packaging with a nationalisation of Owens Illinois glass manufacturers, the company that produces glass bottles (Reardon 2011). In November 2011, the government confiscated 13,000 hectares of land owned by U.K.-based Agroflora (Boothroyd 2011). In May 2012, the government announced its intention to establish Farmapatria, a network of state-run pharamacies to provide price-controlled medicines following a long capital strike in the pharmaceutical industry (Boothroyd 2012).

Even beyond that, one needs to take a world view, in that both food prices and food scarcity levels are being pushed to crisis levels all across the world, due primarily to the toxic dominance of the capitalist agribusiness oligopoly and also financial speculation:

&gt; The government’s food sovereignty reforms occurred against the backdrop of substantial changes in world food markets. Starting in 2006, Venezuela, like most of its peers in Latin America and the rest of the Third World, faced an unprecedented spike in food imports because of intense speculation. In April 2008, the New York Times reported $130 billion new investment in commodity futures trading, with almost half of all futures contracts for corn, wheat and live cattle on New York, Chicago and Kansas City stock markets held by major Wall Street Funds (quoted in McMichael 2009: 282).[7] Between the end of 2007 and mid-2008, the global price of rice skyrocketed by 320%, the price of wheat increased by 210% and the price of corn escalated by 250% (Rossett 2009: 18). Food riots erupted across the world, including in Argentina and Haiti (McMichael 2009: 282). 

As far as crime and insecurity goes, again, to make sense of it one must take a historical and regional viewpoint. All we are hearing about is how at worst "socialist thugs" are behind the nation's crime epidemic, which is of course an absurd suggestion, to at best how the government is too benign, too corrupt, or too incompetent to deal with the crime problem. First of all, these are opinions that are broadly out of touch with the broad spectrum of Venezuelan public opinion. A [Datanalysis poll](http://venezuelablog.tumblr.com/post/63563549714/who-gets-the-blame-for-crime-in-venezuela-citizen) done in late 2013 found that only 27 percent stated that another president would do a better job on crime, while only 6.4 percent cited ineffective government as a perceived cause of the crime problem. Violent crime is a problem affecting the entire continent of Latin America, as the [UNDP determined](http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2013/11/12/citizen-insecurity-thwarts-latin-america-s-development-says-undp.html) that from 2000 to 2010, one in three people had been a victim of violent crime, with over a million murders. As one can see from the [data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) Venezuela's murder rate, while very, very high, is actually on par with neighboring nations in the region such as Colombia, Guatemala, Jamaica, or Honduras (the murder capital of the world). Surely this cannot be disconnected with the highly militarized US war on drugs in Latin America, which has predictably not altered the availability of drugs on US streets, but has unleashed a massive torrent of violence across the continent, claiming over 10,000 lives in Mexico for instance. The major entrance of organized crime and right-wing paramilitary groups (the two typically overlap substantially) from Colombia into Venezuela, leading to a great expansion of the drug trade in major cities, esp. Caracas, over the past decade is a [major cause](http://mondediplo.com/2010/08/07venezuela). 

Not to mention that the Chavistas inherited in the late 1990s one of the most notoriously corrupt and violent police forces in the continent, with the scattered local departments being under the control of local politicians. One can read about some of the various problems with policing today *as well as* the government's efforts to deal with this problem [here.](http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/10166)
-----==----==---==-----
This is pathetic. Don't get me wrong, I do think there is plenty to protest about in Venezuela but there is no fucking way I can back the opposition. The Venezuelan working class needs to go their own way and bring change themselves. Fuck the government and the rich elite. 
-----==----==---==-----
Not surprising. Mainstream bourgeois media is incredibly dangerous in its manipulation and functions as ideology.
-----==----==---==-----
Can anybody supply an actual explanation of what is going on in Venezuela, or are we simply going to bicker over which side to pick?

[These are obviously caribineros](http://i.imgur.com/U8OXZYd.jpg).  Venezuelan riot police don't dress in olive drab.

Is funny because Oficialism is doing the same, they both shop pics, this doesn´t make me a oposition supporter, in fact the oposition and oficialism are both pretty much killing my nation.

None of the 2 parties involved in this conflict has a clue on what to do to fix the current situation, I don't know what is worse the infection or the cure, we are truly fucked.

-----==----==---==-----
So... Someone anonymous, who must have like two followers, posts a picture of a previous manifestation on his twitter account, and that is "Opposition lies and manipulation"? You're funny.
-----==----==---==-----
See this is funny, if it were socialist protests we wouldn't do this. But here we are. With no mention of Venezuela anywhere on our front page despite it being really one of the last remaining socialist country left.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm confused. The protesters are using false images? Or the government is making them look bad?
-----==----==---==-----
I am a venezuelan, protesting this week and will continue to protest as long as we, the venezuelan people, continue to suffer the opression from this government. First of all, the images you posted are all fake and don't represent what is going on in Venezuela. The goverment manipulates the "Mainstream bourgeois media", because all the channels are controlled by goverment. 


Mind you I was on today's protest on the anti-government side, this means I'm biased. You may not know, but Venezuela is spiraling into debt. With Chavez death and the rule of President Nicolás Maduro, we had two bid devaluations. The Dollar went from 4,30 Bs (Bolivares "Fuertes") to 11,36 approx. on one year. We can't find basic food elements like milk, flour, cooking oil, and even toilet paper on our marts and markets, this scarcity is beyond patience: http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/sep/26/venezuela-food-shortages-rich-country-cia

Insecurity is rampant. We are now one of the most violent countries on the world. We had even one of our Miss Venezuela killed, it wasn't because she was famous, not because she had money, it wasn't a hitman. She died with same modus operandi every Venezuelan gets killed. The government is secretly working with a lot of "collectives" (mafias, armed groups, violent gangs) as means of intimidation and is turning a blind eye to violence. Here is a video of the police and government enforcers shooting and kicking people: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrpihh6mewQ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsjIb62_PoM
Here are some videos of these armed collectives shooting protesters: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mb97ZcOd8g http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3DS2uxihGk you can see one protester shot death and the police not doing anything.

Police brutality against protesters (not today, not in Caracas but in Mérida) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15xj1Tf3sU0

Armed collectives shooting and robbing. These are the Tupamaros, considered a legal political party: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC_K3oPeQ0A http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNULcdQ6a0I#t=20 

You won't find this on the news except on CNN. Our TV media is buyed by the goverment. It was funny and infuriating watching TV today and finding soup operas an bullshit shows while everybody was marching and the tension was boiling.

Pardon my writing. I can't write well due to anger. There is so much more about this but I can't think straight, I'm too damn angry right now, so I think this info is kinda limited. I hope someone complement this.

Edit: Some pics: http://imgur.com/a/hvw4J#JH1ue46

Edit 2: Thanks /u/faxon and some some others user I can't find the name right now, for the gold! Thanks brothers!

Edit 3: Another protester dead, apparently by the government sponsored armed collectives I mentioned about. https://twitter.com/jennyoro1/status/433771586227683330/photo/1 Official numbers: 3 deaths, 26 injured.

There is a obligatory country wide public announcement by the government (We call it cadenas, I don't know the English translation, they are very common). A civic-military parade with people smiling, music and happiness all around commemorating El Día de la Juventud while the tensions are still up in the streets. Tomorrow is going to be a long day...

Edit 4: It Official: "Maduro forbids spontaneous protests on the country "quien quiera protestar o marchar en cualquier lugar del país debe tener permiso y si no es así, serán detenidos." - "Those who wants to protest or rally up anywhere on the country must have permission, otherwise, they will be detained. As if the President would give permissions to protests against him...
Edit 5: Oh! I forgot to say this. Our Exchange-rate regime is too severe. The now official figure is 1$ = 11,36 Bs. approx., but the black market figure is 84 Bs. as of today. Our economy is so fucked up that the official rate is not as used as the black market rates on commercial establishments because the government has barely any money left."


Furhermore, the government claims to be "socialist" but the Venezuelan Public Works and Housing Minister, Diosdado Cabello, was on National TV today wearing a North Face jacket, and talking smack about the US goverment, and how bad capistalism is. Please!!! Even the President, Nicolas Maduro, was using an ipad to follow the points of his "speech"  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BgpXQ41CYAAhbv1.jpg:large


Furthermore, I invita you all to check out some of this photos from the protest, and to read the news. Ooops I forgot the venezuelan government cut the transmission of the only channel showing the status of the country.

Here's the truth: a few people from the opposition used fake images. Here are some real ones, and videos, of what is currently happening in Venezuela:

What is happening is Venezuela is very real. Even our "President" finally admitted that there were things happening, and he never speaks of the problems until they become too big of a deal.

I'll start with the simple one

&gt; I know that Marx talks about how the proletariat will increase in numbers at the expense of the bourgeoisie.

Look around you. Corporate businesses are destroying small businesses all over the world. Petty bourgeois are extremely important to a capitalist society yet capitalism itself destroys them. This being the contradiction.

&gt; So I would assume that some capitalists would have to cut back on production and lay off workers because of losses, and this would result in an economic recession. However, what exactly are the consequences of the crisis of overproduction?

That's what most businesses would do. Look at the great depression. There were a lot of roles for it's cause, but overproduction was one of them. An overall effect would be that economic circulation would come to a stop. A country's GDP would collapse. 

_______

&gt; Also I'm not very clear on Marx's position on global expansion: does he argue that capitalism expands across the globe, after which nations will undergo proletarian revolutions? 

I found a great article on it [here](http://www.isreview.org/issues/56/feat-grossman.shtml)

&gt; And how exactly does the crisis of overproduction, expansion of the proletariat, and global expansion of capitalism result in a proletariat revolution in which a dictatorship of the proletariat is established? I know that it has something to do with "class consciousness" but I don't fully understand that concept 

Class consciousness is when the proletariat understands it's role in the system. Overproduction will cause some sort of economic depression which will unite the proletariat. Again look at the great depression. Workers united and official socialist/communist parties rose over unions. They made demands, and unfortunately those demands were met. It created a them vs us situation which is class consciousness. The expansive and defining of the proletariat will also cause a revolution. As small business die, capital falls into the hands of the few creating what we see the 1%. Class consciousness is realizing that they are the 1% and we are the 99% and we want a revolution and that is exactly what occupy wall street attempted.

On crisis theory, unfortunately you won't fund much more than bare bones in Marx's Capital and even then most of that is located in vol 2 and 3. Reading the posts in order on this [blog](http://critiqueofcrisistheory.wordpress.com/the-problem-marx-didnt-leave-us-a-completed-crisis-theory/) was really illuminating for me.

"I understand that this eventually leads to a crisis of overproduction in which the contradictions of the capitalist system makes it impossible for the proletariat to buy all the goods the bourgeoisie produce: the capitalists are selling the products at a higher price then the wage they are giving workers."

This is a common misunderstanding. What Marx means by overaccumulation is not an overaccumulation of consumer goods but an overaccumulation of capital, meaning an excess of capital that can't find sufficiently profitable investments. This is due to the falling rate of profit, which is caused by a growth in the costs of constant capital(fixed capital, raw materials, etc) relative to the workers employed.

Sorry I don't have time to respond to anything else...

I am part of my local IWW branch. Because of my beliefs I refuse to support any other type of Union. I'm also against any formation of a vanguard party. A revolution will occur from capitalism's own contradictions. I think we can see this happening today. Things like occupy wall street have shown that people are realizing what the capitalist mode of production causes. Socialism is becoming less of a dirty word. On the flip side if a revolution doesn't occur, we'll be thrown into world war 3.

I believe what we should do right now is educate. If a revolution is going to happen the masses need to know what should secede it. This is why I've proposed things like raising money for socialist based social media ads. I started /r/westernterrorism so people can see how awful capitalism is. You have to remember that propaganda has a multiplying effect. When you branch out to a few, they branch out to others and then you have the masses on your side.

As a last note being revolutionary doesn't mean you have to be the next Che Guevara. It just means you understand a revolution is necessary and ideas like revisionism are flawed. Like most people here when the time comes I will be willing to help. But what we need to do now is prepare, and the best way to do that is through education of the masses.

I think you've assumed that everyone on this sub believes in revolution. That's not the case.

I'm relatively knew to this thinking but occupy did guide me here after being relatively undecided ,although knowing society is fixed in a certain matter. After discovering Chomsky,Parenti, Bookchin , Zinn, Naomi Klein, Chris Hedges (yes I know some of you don't like him but being somewhat a political but anti-right, his critiques were aligned with the rest to an extent) and others I find my self here.  Not sure what "label" if any Id want to give myself but I do agree with bringing democracy in the work place and from what I can tell just by observation there seems to be lots of different "sects" of Socialism that don't all agree of exactly the same ideas and while its great to have differing opinions and ideas it seems like thats the biggest problem is agreeing on a basic unifying program.  It seems like some are "waiting" for a revolution to happen, some are open even entering into our current system of politics,some are not. I don't see why not attack it on all sides instead of being so nit picky about all of it, anything that gets the message out and normalizes the word "socialist" in apolitical/ otherwise non socialists heads without diluting the term sounds like a good idea as well doesn't it?

I am not a union member, although I would dearly love to see my workplace unionized.

I am a member of a socialist organization, and although it's hardly large enough to be called a party, we are trying to build groundwork for a future revolutionary party, of which we hope eventually to be a part.

When working in movements, we have to consider why we are there *as socialists*.
Are we building towards the revolutionary party, providing socialist analysis to explain the inequities and contradictions of the present system? Are we convincing people of the need (and possibility!) to organize to overthrow this entire system and replace it with a thoroughly democratic, socialist society? Are we mere radical activists, or are we actually bringing people on board to our project?
