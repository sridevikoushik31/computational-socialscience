Im not the biggest fan of non violent tactics and im highly critical of it but seeing 70% of folks walkout while that radscum was speaking really made me happy.

"Attendees were required to check their bags before entering, and security and police forces were standing by throughout all parts of the EMU Ballroom. Regardless of strong police preparation in case of a violent of rowdy demonstration, the event remained calm for all but for a quiet walkout during Keith’s performance and a rally in the EMU amphitheater."

So when people call the USSR state capitalism, they are using a particular definition of the word capitalism. In this definition capitalism means a system where one group of people does the work and a different group of people directs the work and makes all the decisions, including how to spend the surplus generated by the work. 

So the USSR clearly met this definition of capitalism. They replaced capitalist bosses with Communist Party commissars but the workers themselves still had no power on the job. So people came up with the name "state capitalism" to describe this, because they wanted to emphasize that Soviet "Communism" was actually similar to capitalism in this way. 

In this view true socialism or communism would eliminate class distinction by making the workers their own bosses through more some kind of workplace democracy or consensus process. The key feature of this idea of socialism is that the people who make the decisions are the ones who actually do the work, instead of some separate group of people.

Hi! /u/tacos_4_all gave a great answer, but I would like to encourage you to direct questions like this to /r/Anarchy101
-----==----==---==-----
I think degenerated workers' state and soviet economy are the best terms.
-----==----==---==-----
Because capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production and in this case the means of production was owned by the state. While the state should serve to distribute the wealth of the means of production, the Soviet state was corrupt and in effect meant that a small class of people in government owned the means of production, giving us what's satirically referred to as state capitalism.

It really boils down to the large soviet bureaucratic machine not totally representing the individual, and this is a problem you're always going to see with states.

-----==----==---==-----
State-controlled economy sounds good, sure.  But it was certainly no state controlled socialism, if such a thing is possible.  There were a small number of people in control of the capital and they used that capital to demand the labor of the workers.  There was just some slight differences in the bureaucratic structuring of the ownership.  There were certainly differences from capitalism in Western countries or today, but no differences that seem like enough of a difference to make a difference from an Anarchist perspective. 
-----==----==---==-----
I've always used the term state capitalism to describe the United States
-----==----==---==-----
According to Marx's historical materialism:

feudalism -&gt; capitalism -&gt; communism.

Russia was at stage one and since it couldn't just to step three directly they went through a period of deliberate capitalism.

&gt;Wonder what the FBI will say if they discover the culprit is someone who lives in Atherton and is a son or daughter of a 1%er…

The resistance may be spreading, and it's come to pass that no one can be considered a protected person when they have network access. Everyone can be compromised, the impressionable youth will be a Peid-pippers worst nightmare should they find out he's only doing it because their parents did not pay him. But then who would even bother listening to them as not only are they too embarassed to admit their mistake it's already clear to the authorities who is at fault?

&gt;One also has to wonder what groups the FBI is tracking to find out who was tagging rich homes?

I wonder what the FBI does when it's not recreating the crime scene? I mean really, this sounds like a `very serious crime` that threatens [national security](http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/evolution-not-revolution-the-fbi-9816) in a way that demands immediate attention. I mean if garage doors all around Atherton, California, are being vandalized perhaps a synchronized effort will be undertaken (by some sort of "Home-Owners Association" of the colluding deluded) to replace the garage doors simultaneously, exposing their vintage automobiles to more sun than they should be, decreasing their value. **Oh these children are only hurting themselves** in the long run because those cars were bought with the money that could have been spent on them instead. 

&gt;Is this an excuse for them to do more domestic spying?

Like the alphabet soup agencies need an excuse. The FBI may in fact be supplying these spray paint cans into the area if only because the kids were bored and you know bored kids could think of worse to do by themselves. They often do, but if only it were actually true that the children were their parents biggest worry; the speculation was fun but it must end. All good things get there.

&gt;Should any of us who are members of organizations avoid any and all conversations about wealth disparities lest we become suspicious to the FBI?

The FBI probably finds its own actions more than conspicuous enough to make its own behavior suspiscious. If they don't ask questions in a manner that looks normal for them to keep up on then we can conclude that they're already watching; we want them to waste their time reproducing what they know to be true because that way they'd have to ask someone too. If you think you are in the right side of history do you feel your behaviour changes upon the actions of your enemy? 

&gt;Will the FBI be on the case if someone spray paints something bad about the poor.

On a garage door owned by someone who's rich enough to complain very loudly, often and insistently? I hope not, cause then they'd get what they deserve, which is a break from having to do any real police work. After all, they need more people to answer the constant complaints that come to them for being unable to solve every case of vandalism that the municipal police shrug off and state police can't catch. 

&gt;What if someone heads on over to a poor neighborhood and spray paint on one of the buildings  ‘Get a Job you Lazy Bums’, will the FBI be tracking groups like the Tea Party?

Does the Tea Party blame Obama? Honestly maybe whomever writes that will apply for a tax write off, calling it a charitable contribution to funding the **community** `revitalizement` *in progress*? I mean don't the rich people who commit crimes tend to leave a longer paper trail? It should be obvious to see that the Koch Brothers are behind all of this, but I forgot those glasses at the novelty shop without buying them; I guess we'll have to keep rampantly speculating because if I stop calling it that I'm only mentally masturbating. 
-----==----==---==-----
Blah blah blah. Some rich kid hates his parents blah blah blah. White people are destroying West Oakland blah blah.

&gt;The lesson here is don’t pull a gun on a deputy.

um... shouldn't the lesson be that barging into someone's house unannounced is a bad idea no matter who you think you are?
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;The police have justified their search by reminding the public that they did find a small amount of marijuana.

Oh okay I guess all is well then /s.

-----==----==---==-----
“Age does not preclude somebody from being aggressive toward deputies,” he said. “The lesson here is don’t pull a gun on a deputy.”

Wow. These fuckers have no grasp on reality. 
-----==----==---==-----
We have to do something about that euphemism. Until I noticed subreddit this was posted on I thought it was talking about literal pigs.
-----==----==---==-----
no the police tried justifying it by saying "The lesson here is dont pull a gun on a deputy" -sheriffs department spokesperson. That wouldn't have worked in Texas at all! FUCK THAT SHIT!
-----==----==---==-----
So, TL;DR Someone thought it'd be funny for an old man to get raided, old man gets murdered by cops. Has a little weed and nothing else. Correct?
-----==----==---==-----
I'm trying to wrap my head around why this happens at all other than the fact that the officers intend to bungle this badly and haze the public. 
-----==----==---==-----
Calling cops pigs dehumanizes them - then you expect less of them and they and their friends and family ignore your arguments. Yes, cops are human beings with friends and family, too. We want them to feel guilt about being party to murder.

This was one of the dumbest podcasts I've ever listened to.

Firstly, he is blatently factually wrong about the Pound Sterling. The Pound is controlled by the Bank of England, which can deny Scotland use of the currency. It is not at all obvious that Scotland will continue to use the Pound Sterling, particularly as George Osbourne has said no. 

Secondly, he is blatently factually wrong about EU membership. I can't believe people are still trying to find controversy in this, when legal opinion has been stated time and time again. The rest-of-the-UK (rUK) would be the successor state if Scotland leaves, with all rights and treaties still standing. Scotland will be a new country, needing to apply for EU membership and membership of all other international organisations.

He says that outside the EU, the UK could never survive without Scotland. This is just nonsense that overemphasises Scotland's importance to the UK economy. The UK wouldn't be able to survive regardless of Scotland's inclusion.

He also fantasises about "civil disorder" in Scotland. Somehow if there is a close vote, Scotland is going to devolve into civil war? After the failure of the 1979 referendum, the Yes people were upset, but didn't decide to start an armed insurrection. He doesn't seem to be able to speculate about an actually realistic outcome of Scottish independence, which is not more autonomy for Scotland, but just fresh meat for the international neo-liberal death machine.
-----==----==---==-----
This may not be practical advice, but I feel like this is something that you should bring up with the department head. Perhaps someone with more experience can chime in here.

[What we're ranting... I'm good at that. No but seriously, the brunt of the answer to your question is at the bottom (last paragraph) of this wall of venting.]

What's the goal here, demystifying the human aspiration that is anarchism?

How do we approach it? An uphill battle, filled with many preconceptions and heavy prejudice.

Public perception through time influenced by actual events, as well the narrative and portrayal put front by dominant forces, have influenced people's disdain to find out what it's really about.

The usual outright dismissal, bomb throwing, chaos loving... The predetermined and sometimes subconscious bias makes it so that it doesn't even require an effort for most to dismiss it outright.

In a way, it's like those  computer tests to see if you're racist. You know you're not racist, not by any stretch of the imagination, but you'll still answer with a racial bias. Heck, to prove my point, lot's of anarchists will suggest agitating without using  the @ word, because we know the mountain of misconceptions. It's so ingrained in us the pejorative connotation of anarchism (although to be honest it was adopted in that sense and we should embrace it), that in certain circumstances we almost kinda say it sideways, or we muffle it almost as we say it,  as like reluctantly entering a sea of ignorance.

I'm guilty of it sometimes, but we should be proud. It's a hard struggle, but it's worth it, as struggle encapsulates the anarchist principle. Also to paraphrase Kropotkin, no true power comes from dishonesty.


Kropotkin: "It is often said that Anarchists live in a world of dreams to come, and do not see the things which happen today. We do see them only too well, and in their true colors, and that is what makes us carry the hatchet into the forest of prejudice that besets us."


Then so, how do we approach reclaiming the 'philosophy of anarchy' to facilitate it's understanding by our fellow workers, and in this case classmates? It's an exercise in agitating, raising consciousness but also in public relations. It's really in our best interest to not only articulate our beliefs (which tend to be fairly loose, at least hopefully not too doctrinaire), but to make it attainable. Something all propagandists should pay mind to.

So what is relatable to the common folk? It depends. I remember reading about Paulo Freire, he was mentioning this socialist agitator, he related a story about him whereby he was a strong atheist, all the while he was propagandizing the social question to these peasants who where devoutly religious. So he was using the "Word of god" to approach the social question, "do you think Jesus would agree with the way wealth is distributed?", "do you think he would agree with the way the tillers are treated?". To me, this speaks of being not only malleable, but strategic? Stand by what you believe in, wear your colors proud, but make it a point to be not only poignant but easily understandable to your surroundings.

Relating to a point made by Voltayrine de Cleyre (american literary talent, poet, feminist and anarchist), we are probably 9/10th emotion, and to dismiss those emotions is to dismiss what sparks concrete change. We should not dismiss straying from rationality to facilitate appealing to emotions. We are but story tellers, the story just so happens to have a factual and historical basis and precedent, and it entails a question so serious as to be almost all encompassing, that is the social question.

The precedent which we are discussing is the all time permeating idea of revolting against authority, which is demonstrable consistently thought the epochs. What makes our job harder explaining anarchism, all the while making somewhat easier to negate it's dismissal, is that it's something that never as really taken place on a grand scale and with it the nonexistent dismissal by applying it's principle to some significance and realizing it's failure, in comparison something we could demonstrate about capitalism, feudalism or State-Socialism. Sure there were anarchistic flareups in France throughout history, Madagascar's political life as been influenced by libertarian ideas, and as we know Spanish revolutionaries in Spain were squashed by the Fascist and reaction destroyed the advancement which were short lived. 

Anarchism is about the struggle and a world to be. As Oscar Wilde so poignantly wrote: "Progress is the realisation of Utopias". We're not utopians. We're not *all* bomb throwers even insurrectionists, and most of us can agree that's it's not a predetermined road to emancipation. We just recognize that the status quo (capitalism, representative governemnt, hierarchy, parliamentary politics, oppression...) doesn't represent the will of the people or fill it's most basic needs. As Foucault put it, and I most definitely relate as an anarchist, 'rejection', 'imagination' and 'innovation'. That's a good starting point. Now how do we rectify? And it's not just the creative passion of destruction, oh no, there are strong notions that are mainstays amongst our currents, just to name a few: internationalism, true federalism, decentralization, free-association/autonomy/individual sovereignty, striving for egalitarianism because poverty is slavery, as well as smashing all oppressive forces like patriarchy, racial oppression... most importantly freedom for all, above all.

We must start by explaining those values that are dear to us, making it relatable in a historical sense, approaching history from the perspective of the people and not the state approved perspective of history.

There is going to be some deconstruction, some required introspection by the recipient of our ideas. It's going to come with discomfort and resistance, even dissonance. But social and political emancipation as been a long time in the making, we probably won't see it in our lifetime but the struggle is worth it no less.

To raise class consciousness, is to embrace the struggle. Take it... , (and I'm also talking to myself here because outrage fatigue takes a toll on all of us) for what it is, progress in the making. Although we won't reap it's rewards, it's our contribution to mankind, that is what needs to be rewarding in itself.

Sorry if I'm going off on a rant, it's just that our mission, facing adversity, can be depressing at times. We must remember that to struggle is to live, and that each little, incremental difference we make will ad up one day to the spark that will set off social revolution as we hope for it, at-least that's what condensed progress/revolutions have proven throughout history. At least one can hope that the people have not reached a level of comfort where subservience and acquiescence prevents them from enacting change. Our surrounding conditions beg to differ, revolution is all around us, now, one can hope the revolutions will not only be political but social in spectrum.

Now, to get back to the point at hand. To make it approachable. Talk of anarchist currents that have benefited us to this day. Anarchistic movements that motivated the end of feudal rights and monarchy in France during the french revolution, anarchists that were big components of the abolitionist movement in America or examples like Emma Goldman campaigning for contraception before it was an issue of it's time. From the antiwar movement, opposition to the Vietnam war, to upheaval throughout the world going on to this day, from south America to Egypt, anarchist are involved in the peoples causes. The workers movement and all it's advancement, facilitated by the radicalism in action or implied of the syndicalists. Anarchism has always been a part of civilization, and will be a part always in the struggle, till civilization ends and change as we know it. Even then, there will always be place for adaptation and betterment and we will be there. I don't know if this was meant to inspire you, to put your foot down next class and call people out on there bullshit, or if I'm in need of renewed inspiration myself, but like Kropotkin says: "We need moral progress, but without moral courage, moral progress is impossible." And we will all need this moral courage, you included, it's just something that I think we all need to be reminded daily. So be courageous, face some semblance of adversity, you are faced with an opportunity to rectify those prejudices. It's not going to be easy, but raise your hand say something, or my advice to you, print a tract of your choice, something easy to digest and hand it to each student your next class. I would suggest Kropotkin's entry for the definition of Anarchism in the Encyclopedia Brittanica, it's succinct and to the point. If anybody as a better suggestion for a short introductory text, I welcome them to mention it. But I think this could be a proactive/productive approach to rectifying the lack of knowledge and it could motivate further discourse.
-----==----==---==-----
Welcome to hegemony.
-----==----==---==-----
Start an anarchist/socialist reading group. Print flyers and hang them around your school. Check around maybe some professor will want to be an adviser for it. If not, you can start it and see if anybody shows up. This will have the additional benefit of helping you meet all the coolest people at your school. Your book club can also easily become an activist group. You can attend the next anti-capitalist convergence with your book club. 

On the other hand you could also have a conversation with your teacher after class. It's possible she doesn't know much about anarchism. Start by asking her a few probing questions to gauge what she knows. If she's ignorant there is no sense getting upset about it, it's been that way for a long time. Do the book club. 

-----==----==---==-----
Welcome to the fatal flaw in the professionalisation of knowledge! Speaking hyperbolically, when the correct answer is whatever the teacher says, students aren't learning knowledge, they're inheriting opinion.
-----==----==---==-----
Show this teacher some Anarchist material (e.g Bakunin and Choamsky) can't say it will work. You could also show her some stuff from anarchists in Spain and their communities. Who knows? You could change the way your school see's Anarchists (or not since it's state run and anything against statism is automatically bad.) Educate the people comrade!

-----==----==---==-----
Sociology was a field made up to sciencize political opinions. Its not for the casual, or moderate either. Its for those desperate to enamor their opinions as unshakable truth. its a complete disrespect to the sciences, and everything science stands for.

Sure you see quite a few radical leftists, especially in college(Karl Marx himself was considered the grandfather of all Sociology), but you also see the extremes on the other end with social darwinism, and various third positionists, who now seem more dominant.(its practicle, they seem to advocate themselves as unshakable masters of society we need to listen to, advocate polices that would give them more control over people's lives).
-----==----==---==-----
Professors can be very intellectually limited. College is often just school 2.0.

So many juicy comments in there, but I laughed pretty hard at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/1z283h/subjective_theory_of_value_vs_labor_theory_of/cfq9hnr);

"I have met socialists in real life. One of them ripped me off pizza money. But I forgive. Be happy you only have to deal with them online!"

I see that attitude frequently in ancap/libertarian circles. People who agree with me must be pretty cool, and people who don't agree with me must be liars, thieves, and scoundrels! Even when I *was* an AnCap I scratched my head at the idea. For a lot that like to preach the values of individualism they sure are great at propping up tribalistic strawmen/boogeymen.
-----==----==---==-----
I've gotten this more than once. They really don't like it when you reject economics as a relevant thing to talk about.

I think the problem is that they read all sorts of ancap bullshit, and then refuse to read anything socialist ever.
-----==----==---==-----
ITT: We circlejerk about shitposting from a heterogenous community, thereby completing the shitposting cycle. 
-----==----==---==-----
I think its called projection, they just talk about what would be an obvious critique of themselves, and pin it on you, before you say it. Not the first person I've seen do that. They are using critiques against them as stock critiques of their critics.

But again, its what happens when you devolve to diaelectics, you debate to win personally, not to represent any idea.

Lotta groups are guilty of this, and I dare say its all ancaps, or they started it, or its mostly ancaps.
-----==----==---==-----
So are you going to make a new sock every time you want to circumvent your ban just to link to yourself? I dare say that level of narcissism is completely incompatible with anti-capitalism.
-----==----==---==-----
mfw you quote me as an ancap ಠ_ಠ
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;&gt; LTV states that the value of labor is equal to its product.

&gt;This I can agree with. I do not agree that value is created by labor, since it can be created without labor.

This isn't the talk of an ancap. This is the talk of an actual anarchist who subscribes to the subjective theory of value.
-----==----==---==-----

So, I usually don't go for accusations that can't be "proven" but this is beyond the pale and worth pointing out.  Go to the comment section on that article, check out the dozen or so people at different points with the same message that "these stories are getting old," "the guardian is getting boring," "how is this relevant."  

Note that this story is probably the most damaging to come out yet.  The NSA is bulk collecting millions of webcam images from random people everywhere and storing them.  For the lolz I guess who knows.

I don't think that World War 3 is coming, this is a bit over the normal saber-rattling but if Russia tries to fuck with the EU they'll lose their biggest gas customers. [Germany is Russias largest gas customer](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/24/us-ukraine-crisis-gas-europe-idUSBREA1N0SR20140224), Europe relies on Russia for a lot of their gas. I keep trying to say that it's unlikely these two will fight over influence in the Ukraine because Russia will not win (and relies on [French selling Warships](http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/russia-to-order-french-mistral-lhds-05749/) to them). 

In this day and age Russia doesn't have the same allies that it did in WW1 (against Germany). They're part of the [Partnership for Peace](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_82584.htm) with NATO. 

If you're looking for **a real war threat** please try looking at how China maybe ready to fight Japan in a [short and sharp war](http://news.usni.org/2014/02/18/navy-official-china-training-short-sharp-war-japan) that America may not be ready to react to in time; Japan can't stand up to China alone for long, and China has to act quickly before their anti-ship guided missile technology is rendered obsolete (because it travels low and fast instead of a traditional high arc traditional ABM systems have a harder time with it I think). 

Yes the Middle East is contentious but Russia isn't going to war with the EU; They'd lose badly and unless they've gone absolutely insane they know they can't win. 

I think we may see continuing proxy wars in the Mid East, South Asia, North Africa and lower-level conflicts in areas closer to the EU, PRC and USA. 

A world war maybe in the making, but I do not think it will have a European theatre. How about that?

Well they didn't get syria to kick off like they wanted, now they are going to try with Ukraine. It never ends
-----==----==---==-----
I guess it's just the continued (relatively) cold war simmering.  But there's certainly danger of a sharp outbreak, with so many things transforming in ways that scare people in various ways.
-----==----==---==-----
It seems there are 3 factions on the world stage which have grown and given us this conundrum.  EU, American(NATO), and BRICS.  A plan to create 3 world-wide regions then the final coupe to rule them all.

It takes around 20 years to plan for a war, and believe me they are planned.  The missile deterrent shield built around Russia, the fomenting of regime change and dare I say the installing of puppet leaders and faux democracy in all countries failing to join the first two groups.  Also realize the the countries undergoing strife did not have private national banks.  The government coined it's own currency, but not any more.

All this was planned and started around 1995.  IF the Ukraine falls to EU and/or American influences as in taking the IMF bribe and allowing outside influences to corrupt what should be a system of the people who know the truth of what is going on, then strategically it opens up a corridor right to the heart of Russia.  We are witnessing an attempted coupe de grace. 

Hold on to your hats, kerchiefs, and each other, this June things should prove quite interesting.  Russia in the past has been known as the sleeping bear, but it has been waking up for the last 20 years studying the chess board all the while.

Hahaha, what bullshit. First of all, the author of the article can't even get the name of the supposed "Nazi group" - its Praviy Sektor, not Leviy. "Praviy" means right or just, "leviy" means Left. So the Left Sector executed a bunch of people?

Furthermore, "Crimean" isn't an ethnicity. Ukrainian is, Tatar is, Russian is - but not "Crimean". The above mentioned three groups live in Crimea, a peninsula.

Finally, the video was uploaded on the 21st of February - **six** days ago. And this is the only source or report in 6 days for a massacre, which created a "mass grave"? Bull-*shit*.

This is a silly, shitty piece of propaganda. Do some research before posting this kind of crap.

Edit: Do we see any bodies? Any people with cut off ears, any mass graves with bodies in them that have been executed with headshots? No. So just fuck off, really, and stop regurgitating Kremlin propaganda.

This is why I wanted to puke on POTUS during the state of the union. He said "As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel – a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side."

It will never work as a two-state solution. Palestinians need to have equal and full citizenship under the law of an Israel-Palestine single state. Enclosing them in their marginalized current territories will leave the with no resources, and as non-citizens of Israel. If the two-state solution (which will never be implemented) DID happen, Israel could wage war on a "foreign enemy state" of Palestine without any international backlash, because "war is just business, carry on"

Here's hoping that the youth of Palestinians and Israelis come together to overthrow the authoritarian government there and establish true peace

&gt; It quickly becomes clear though that for Chang . . . communication is paramount; conveying his ideas to as broad an audience as possible is a duty, rather than a chore.

And it shows in his writing. He works very hard to explain seemingly-complex and obscure ideas in plain language and lucid writing that is free from pretentious and unnecessary academese jargon. I say "works very hard" because anyone who has tried to write about ideas knows that it is very difficult to do so in an accessible manner that the layperson can understand. In fact, it is much easier to clutter your writings with academic polysyllables and terminology than it is to clear your writing of it.

&gt; “We’ve got this profession wrong; a lot of professional economists think what they do is too difficult for ordinary people. You’d be surprised how often these people are stupid enough to say things, at least in private, like ‘you wouldn't understand what I do even if I explained it to you’. If you cannot explain it to other people, *you* have the problem.” He bemoans that, although he argues 95 per cent of economics is “common sense”, the gulf between academic specialists and the general public has become dangerously vast. 

Spot on. And it's not just economists. This also happens in a great deal of the social sciences and humanities. I absolutely despise social science and humanities academics who insist that their subjects are too difficult for non-academics or laypersons. I absolutely despise *even more* people who defend the writings of these academics as being difficult and impenetrable by necessity. 

Protip: There is nothing in the social sciences or humanities that is so complicated that it can't be explained in plain, everyday language. If popular science writers like Neil Shubin, V.S. Ramachandran, Richard Feynman, Brian Greene and Carl Sagan can write about the most difficult and complicated of topics in the natural sciences in plain, everyday language, then there is absolutely no reason why people in the social sciences and humanities can't do the same for their writings on human affairs.

I really like Chang. I may not agree with all of his views (in the end, he's a social democrat who defends the state, and is not an anarchist), but I highly respect him and value him, much more so than the kind of obscurantist writers that many of my fellow comrades unfortunately adore, like Foucault, Althusser, Butler or Guattari, or any of these other posturing jokers who unfortunately get so much love in radical circles.

-----==----==---==-----
I read 'Bad Samaritans' by Chang, and it's pretty eye opening.  i don't see much changing though.  The people with money and power are benefitting from this system, and they are convinced its a fair and equal system.  people are going to have to get really angry to make changes.

Apparently the Chicago school has had a profound effect even outside of its fringe. The dogmatism referred to in the quote reminds me of Frank Knight, one of the founders of the Chicago school: "Certainly the large general courses should be prevented from raising any question about objectivity, but should assume the objectivity of the slogans they inculcate as a sacred feature of the system."

From Emma Goldman's [*My Disillusionment in Russia*](http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bright/berkman/bmyth/bmch13.html):

&gt; I broached the subject of the Anarchists in Russia. I showed him a letter I had received from Martens, the Soviet representative in America, shortly before my deportation. Martens asserted that the Anarchists in Russia enjoyed full freedom of speech and Press. Since my arrival I found scores of Anarchists in prison and their Press suppressed. I explained that I could not think of working with the Soviet Government so long as my comrades were in prison for opinion’s sake. I also told him of the resolutions of the Moscow Anarchist Conference. He listened patiently and promised to bring the matter to the attention of his party. “But as to free speech,” he remarked, “that is, of course, a bourgeois notion. There can be no free speech in a revolutionary period. We have the peasantry against us because we can give them nothing in return for their bread. We will have them on our side when we have something to exchange. Then you can have all the free speech you want — but not now. Recently we needed peasants to cart some wood into the city. They demanded salt. We thought we had no salt, but then we discovered seventy poods in Moscow in one of our warehouses. At once the peasants were willing to cart the wood. Your comrades must wait until we can meet the needs of the peasants. Meanwhile, they should work with us. Look at William Shatov, for instance, who has helped save Petrograd from Yudenitch. He works with us and we appreciate his services. Shatov was among the first to receive the order of the Red Banner.”

&gt; Free speech, free Press, the spiritual achievements of centuries, what were they to this man? A Puritan, he was sure his scheme alone could redeem Russia. Those who served his plans were right, the others could not be tolerated.

From Rudolf Rocker's [*Nationalism and Culture*](http://libcom.org/library/14-socialism-state):

&gt;When Lenin -- much in the style of Mussolini -- dared to say that "freedom is a bourgeois prejudice," he only proved that his spirit was quite incapable of rising to socialism, but had remained stuck in the old ideas of Jacobinism. Anyway, it is nonsense to speak of libertarian and authoritarian socialism. Socialism will either be free or it will not be at all. 
-----==----==---==-----
In the quote, an attempt is made to mischaracterize Lenin.  It is not even worth responding to such texts.  There is a lack of intellectual honesty.

However, if you want to understand what is going on in such statements, these are the relevant texts:

http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/f/r.htm

http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/free-press/ch06.htm

https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ot/zizek.htm

To sum up very briefly, "bourgeois liberty," "bourgeois freedom," etc., are freedoms and liberties dependent on property.  The famous saying goes: "the press is only free if you own one."  Or another classic formulation of "bourgeois equality": 

&gt; The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.

In the linked article, Zizek puts these words in Lenin's mouth:

&gt; with regard to freedom, Lenin is best remembered for his famous retort “Freedom yes, but for WHOM? To do WHAT?”

Zizek is critical of Lenin here, btw.  But the criticism is not from the perspective of defending "bourgeois liberty."

Some anarchist answers throughout time:  
**Pyotr Kropotkin** - the need for mutual aid shapes us at least as much as mutual struggle  
**Mikhail Bakunin** - self-awareness &amp; the instinct to revolt determine the vitality of a species  
**George Barrett** - the capacity for change is a constant, fundamental feature of the universe &amp; human nature  
**Emma Goldman** - the caged animal becomes pathological, therefore we can only learn of human nature in a state of wildness or liberation  
**Voltairine de Cleyre** - "to remain in a continually exalted moral condition is not human nature"; humans pendulate between ecstatic rebellion and complacency or convenience  
**Noam Chomsky** - environment and social institutions largely determine human nature  
**Anarchist FAQ** - hierarchical organisations bring out the worst in human nature  
**John Zerzan** - humans haven't substantially or permanently evolved physically or mentally away from our nomadic foraging Paleolithic ancestors, so we still have similar needs  
**Peter Gelderloos** - humans are not inherently anti-socially selfish, competitive, patriarchal, warlike, or authoritarian

-----==----==---==-----
Personally, I think any argument that centers around "human nature" is nonsense.

I'd argue that a person is the product of a lot of converging things, and it isn't reasonable to say everybody has the same inherent nature, regardless of the situation they are in.

At any rate, philosophers and psychologists don't seem to have nailed down an answer, so I'm going to say, until further notice, that human nature may not exist in the way people like to think.

There is no such thing as human nature. If there was a nature to us then that would justify laws put in place to rule this nature through its understanding, and it would give credence to lawmakers.

On another level, we are all unique individuals and the concept of having a uniform "nature" describing the entirety of humanity goes against this individuality. It defaces us and is nothing more than a [spook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_Max_Stirner), an abstract concept holding no objective meaning whatsoever and simply used to enforce someone's own subjective values onto others.

I would recommend watching the debate between [noam chomsky and michel, "I'll do it for some hash", foucault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wfNl2L0Gf8)


[here's the TL;DR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0dM6j7pzQA)
-----==----==---==-----
There's not one right answer but I think the anarchist view is highly deferential to science on this question. Anarchists are anti-authoritarian in the political sense but do tend to respect expert opinion. So human nature may be what science says it is. Some things are known, some are not. But there are some things in common to all human beings. Part of our nature is that we are mammals, we are related to apes, etc. And then there are those things that make us more uniquely human, where we are different from other animals, like complex systems of ideas and language. So that's human nature. This includes the full range of human behavior including competition and also cooperation. Consider these ideas as explored by Kropotkin in *Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution*.

Also in anarchism there is a deep skepticism that ultimately you can't trust anything but yourself. You should consult experts when needed but each individual in the end must judge for themselves what they should do. This is a thread that goes back at least to Bakunin and probably earlier to the earliest days of modern philosophy with Descartes. Ultimately anarchists think human nature is to question everything and trust nothing. We are that way by our very nature because we do have self awareness and rational thought, and as a result we are aware of our own existence but there isn't much else we can be sure of. An anarchist always reserves the right to make his or her own decisions. 

And there is a bit of a paradox in the anarchist view of human nature, and it is something anarchists share with marxists and others. That is while they do tend to believe in a material, scientific view, they also think that human beings have some value beyond being just a blob of chemicals, or just a bunch of dollar signs in a capitalist economy. People are special somehow. And so from this is where we get the idea that it's not right to exploit others, and we don't want to be exploited ourselves.  It's never been quite clear to me where that view comes from other than a leap of faith. And so I think this places anarchists squarely in the camp of those who can be called "humanists". We believe in human beings. People are important and shouldn't be treated as simply objects to be used. (We can also extend this partly to animals if we want.) Not everyone who calls themselves an anarchist would agree with this. Those are not humanists then. Those are probably nihilists, probably post-left nihilists or something. 

So you see there isn't one agreed upon answer to this question but it is a fascinating topic. This are just my opinions.

I personally feel that the whole debate over a fixed "human nature" is useless and is nothing but intellectual masturbation at best.
-----==----==---==-----
There does not seem to be a consistent view, but AutumnLeavesCascade has given a pretty cool overview, in my opinion. 
Personally, I am skeptical in general, especially when it comes to claims of objectivity, so arguments for a human nature seem to be pretty dubious to me. Whenever someone makes an argument from human nature, I really press how they got to that conclusion, and it usually seems to be based on some type of assumption. 
-----==----==---==-----
The values of the ruling class largely shape popular consciousness and moral values.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm an anarchist and I think we have to accept that men are often violent. I know myself that fighting was one of my favourite things to do as a boy. I believe we are made to fight over women. The thing is to have good violence instead of bad violence. If we accept that there will be violence then we should find a way to control it's bad side effects. Rather than arming everyone with nuclear weapons we should foster an anti weapon culture where men can fight all they want, without weapons.

"I wanted to kill all those who put themselves in the way of my escape." i noticed he mentions shooting a waiter (Etienne?) on his way out to try and escape after the bombing. 

makes for an interesting discussion: do you consider someone like Etienne/the waiter as a part of the bourgeois on this case or a worker caught in collateral? i think in the case of "propaganda of the deed" it's just too easy to throw the baby out with the bathwater so to speak. and in general, the idea of deed itself makes me kind of squeamish, i don't even lie, violence should always be self-defense/last resort *in my opinion*.

Most of the left tends to react hostily towards religion, especially Islam. For me, someone's religion doesn't justify discrimination or oppression. The basic premise of the anarchist argument is everyone should be free to pursue happiness and meaning in life unimpeded regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.

As an anarchist who converted to Islam,  I'd encourage you to research it further to form your own opinion on it. Most people have very little understanding of what the religion actually says and calls for. Instead, most people read about extremists and fundamentalists and paste it onto their experiences with Christianity. For example, Islam is far less hierarchal than Christianity.  Islam doesn't have an organization with the power and reach of the Catholic Church.

On a pragmatic note, if we believe change only comes through collective action, we need to accept we need to work with the over 1 billion Muslims in the world since it's idealistic and fantastical to assume all people will give up their religion.
-----==----==---==-----
Islam is fucking bullshit, just like Christianity. It's responsible for inordinate suffering and oppression. 
 
 Just because we're against being racist (always remember Islam is a religion, not a race) doesn't mean that we should whitewash reality.
-----==----==---==-----
Religion is hierarchical, especially that of Islam. I'm not advocating discrimination, but I'm not particularly friendly to anyone of any faith.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't think less of someone for fallowing a religion, under no circumstance, I see myself judging someone for his or her religions inclinations. I will judge someone for being part of some cults, such as the Cocos, but that's a different story. 


This does not mean, I will not criticize and *"attack"*, those beliefs that go against basic human rights, also, not respecting a religion, does not mean I disrespect the person that fallows it. I don't feel offended if someone attacks my favorite books, the ones that have, over the years made me who I am. 


This goes for all religions, and personally, I consider most religions to go against my political and social beliefs, because, they teach us to be content with the status quo, to accept the world we live on, and hope that things go better because we are good muslin, christian, Buddhist, or what ever. Don't get me started with he idea that some people have more social/political power because they are in touch we God, or something like that. That fucking boils my blood. 



Something I try to live by, don't hate. Hate is useless, and fruitless. Understand, once you understand  something is harder to hate, and easier to fight.

The essential cause of social fascism is fear. People are afraid of their peers, and so emulate them so as to drive their attention away. This makes them a source of fear for others, and the population grows.

Religions are a symptom of social fascism. Nationalism is also a symptom of social fascism. The culture crash of a new religion meeting an entrenched nationalist population that does not include that religion results in a different sort of fear; xenophobia. One cannot conform to the perceived demands of both groups, and so conformism must be rejected in favour of exclusion.

(Disclaimer, I don't know anyone else who holds the following opinion)

People are fully aware that the 'theory' behind a mode of behaviour is wrong, but it is easier to internalise that theory and behave according to it than it is to reject it because it is obviously false. Take away the fear and people tend to reject the theory.

Muslims know that Islam is nonsense. Nationalists know that nationalism is nonsense. How can anyone not? These things *are* nonsense. It's especially clear with religion; people intuitively know the difference between knowledge and faith. People know that something can't be known, because it is nonsense, so they call it faith. They know this, but they don't *admit* it, usually not even to themselves. They are afraid of the consequences if they don't. The source of fear isn't always other people, necessarily, but it usually is (let's not forget that religions invent imaginary people to be afraid of). The same basic principle is true of nationalism, and a whole host of different social phenomena.

Of course, anarchism is different. I'm not just saying that because I'm an anarchist! Anarchists don't emulate one another out of fear of each other; they refuse to behave like those that they fear. The same is true of all rational behaviours- where fear is not a factor, people tend to behave rationally. For example, when you're tending your garden, you're not acting out of fear; you're acting rationally, based on your knowledge and clear wishes, and this dictates your mode of behaviour.

Tl;dr; the enemy of your enemy is not your friend. Both Islam and nationalism/racism are wrong, and should be dismantled with an even hand.

So why do we need government? because without it, people would be free to commit violence and harm against each other right? cause humans are naturally bad right? That's why we have representatives right? to protect us from ourselves right?

So what makes these representatives better than us?

The bad vibe here isn't accidental, in other words.  Of course it could happen to be natural-- if this place was naturally being just a useless mess of trolled arguments (which certainly does happen on the internet) then that would save them some money! ;)  But if at any point this sub got to have a good productive cooperative vibe, &amp;/or more importantly *started getting something done*, they *would* come do something to disrupt it.  They really would and they'd spend as much as it took to get us off-track.  That's why we *cannot possibly productively organize* on this forum, unless we figure out a strategy for doing so under duress and deception.

We don't have a population problem, we have a distrubution problem. We produce enough of everything that everyone could live comfortably and healthily.

Too bad there isn't a market for that sort of thing. 
-----==----==---==-----
the world is not over populated. this is a myth.
-----==----==---==-----
Education and the raising of living standards. Really, just providing a society where sex education and ready access to birth control is No Big Deal would do more to put a dent in population expansion than any grand or dire plan we could come up with. 
-----==----==---==-----
If we had to, we could cram every single person into the island of New Zealand and have the population density of New York City. Or is it that we can fit into Japan? One of the two. Either way, overpopulation isn't a problem for the whole planet, only certain confined areas, and it probably won't be a global issue for some time. It's worth looking at, though.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't think population is the main issue, just how a rising population uses resources. 
-----==----==---==-----
Absolutely not.  We do have some problems with how we're using our resources, obvs.
-----==----==---==-----
Well, to say we have a population problem isn't a radical analysis. Saying capitalism requires an expansion of the workforce to continue growing would be more accurate statement of a problem. But I don't think that is very legitimate. the problem is rather with society relating to nature through shitty social structures. 

The overpopulation problem isn't as big of a problem as it is claimed to be by enviro types. They don't understand shit about where poverty comes from. They say the earth is overpopulated because we don't have enough food for people, or that the overpopulation is going to require ridiculous 1st world  industrialism. I don't think this is true because I think we could sustain billions people if production and social life was restructured. It's the decadent first world that is responsible for most of the destruction that is blamed on overpopulation elsewhere. 

I think industrialism needs to be limited, but I wouldn't necessarily say the problem is with industrialism either, but rather with specific forms of industrialism that have been developed by capitalism. Population and technology/industry are distractions from the true culprit : hierarchical society. Industrial development in the context of an ecological society would likely be integrated with the ecosystem instead of over the ecosystem .  

anywho, the solution to overpopulation would be to reconfigure social life to live according to the ecosystem, which I view as part of the revolution process of smashing hierarchy, or maybe that revolution that smashes social hierarchy would have cascading effects onto our relationship with nature. People could become very aware about any problems with population in that context. Capitalism doesn't enable people to have an ecological understanding. 

Bookchin has written on the population myth. http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/gp/perspectives8.html 
-----==----==---==-----
Yes there is a problem with overpopulation. Obviously there should be no authority dictating if people can procreate. Maybe financial and sexual education and access to birth control. There will always be those who abuse a system meant to aid but it would be hard to find a way around that.
-----==----==---==-----
Do I believe the Earth is overpopulated? Of course! The solution to the problem? Lets name some.

Educate people on procreation and sex so they think about it.

OR.

Take them out.

And I don't think a lot of people support removing around 70% of the worlds population of human beings, I use to think like that, then I realized maybe that's a bit TOO much.
-----==----==---==-----

I think it's wrong to think that someone in charge of a firm want's laissez-faire capitalism across the board, or that free markets are synonyms to capitalism. The capitalist wants to make as much money as possible. Now externally, that means a lack of regulations, and a dis empowered people which he/she can steam-roll as he pleases. But internally, the capitalist want's tight control over his/her workers.
Perhaps a free market isn't the right way to think about what a capitalist desires. An individual capitalist wants the market where he has the upper hand (think monopoly). However, a group of capitalists can unite on the banner of an equal lack of regulation, and this is where the support for the free market by capitalists comes from.
-----==----==---==-----
The actual answer is because they want to secure ossified hierarchies of management and actual market pressures internally would tear those apart. What little value management actually adds / what little meaningful work they contribute would be visible in an actual market, whereas in a bloated firm elaborate hierarchies of control and exploitation are possible. Hence why capitalists work so hard at suppressing the free market externally so that large firms can compete/dominate our economy.

Hodgson's mistake here is in identifying "market like incentives" as vicious competition, when Graeber and a ton of other writers have shown that actual freed markets tend towards more cooperative dynamics (and anyway cooperation and competition are not inherently opposites, see play for example).

Indeed Hayek's critique of state communism's economic calculation clusterfuck is increasingly seen as *also* an attack upon capitalism, since large accumulations of capital likewise provide calculational nightmares. Rothbard and the early ancaps realized that this analysis made corporations and large firms sketchy, but hushed that up and shied away from pursuing the conclusion.

As a post-leftist I oppose the sort of cooperation Hodgson is implicitly singing the praises of because I'm suspicious organizations wholesale. A firm's persistence is an unresponsive ossification of social relations, placing the spook of an organization above the organic needs of the individuals that comprise it.
-----==----==---==-----
well yeah, most capitalist workplaces in the production process are very cooperative. That's how production is able to achieve its successes: workers cooperating together to produce. Pretty much all production is a cooperative process, even in a market society. It's just that there are capitalist leaches who sit above this process and extract profit from it, which they are able to do via institutional power provided by the state and property enforcement. 

 Veblen, an institutionalist, made this point that the economy has two aspects: industry and business. Industry itself describes production (including workers) and depends on and desires smooth cooperation and coordination from all its elements (like a how a machine needs coordinated and cooperative parts to function). But the business side is based on the boss sabotaging this smooth functioning process to leverage profit. 
-----==----==---==-----
To look at it another way: Perhaps the class rule of the managers operates in a different way from the "ideal" of capitalism.  Berle and Means describes this almost a century ago.
-----==----==---==-----
Because working together is stupid
-----==----==---==-----
Because, for capitalists, the free market is for other people not themselves.

It's a joke to hear capitalists talk about the "calculation problem" that can only be solved with the market, when giant multinational firms figure it out literally every minute of every day without reference to markets.
-----==----==---==-----
The existence of the firm is not a mystery. It does have to do with protection, but nothing to do with learning. 

Free markets do lead to cooperation--the cooperation of rich people to protect what they have from everyone else. Regulation is a product of free markets. That's why so many of the regulations favor business (i.e. patent, trademark, copyright, limited liability, subsidized research, etc.).

I'm glad someone asked this. As the economic situation gets worse and worse and anti-capitalist movements grow larger and larger it is expected that states will get more repressive and desperate to maintain the status quo. We should discuss tatics for rooting out informants and agent provocateurs. 

Next time it could be the NATO 30 instead of the NATO 3 as anxious pigs use RICO laws to round up not only the naive comrades they've entrapped but every activist those comrades knew as well.
-----==----==---==-----
While no methodology is perfect, here's a 16-page [Profile of Provocateurs](https://ia601002.us.archive.org/14/items/ProfilesOfProvocateurs/profilesofprovocateurs_web.pdf) by Kristian Williams. If you have good security culture, infiltration should not be as much an issue. What it comes down to is developing your own "red flags" for sketchy behavior, developing a basic level of group consensus on goals and values and appropriate behavior, and identifying or calling out abusive or derailing behavior where you see it without necessarily calling someone a cop.
-----==----==---==-----
A spy will probably push for more radical action than the group as a whole seems prepared to do. Even if the group rebukes the spy's ideas, that won't be the end of it. The spy will persist, probably even insulting members of the group, saying they aren't really serious anarchists or something.

I haven't had any experience with infiltration, but from news reports and documentaries I've gleaned a bit of knowledge on state tactics. Still, you should probably listen to those who have experience with this sort of thing.
-----==----==---==-----

Nine times out of ten it seems like they are not catching people who want to commit illegal acts, but rather entrapping people or nudging people to commit illegal acts who would not do so otherwise.
-----==----==---==-----
The attempts that I've encountered have been obvious. Cops dressing in plain clothes asking obvious questions. Of course, we've all heard the horror stories about years long informants and snitches. The truth is that you can't really know, but you can keep your wits about you and keep the hairy stuff among people that you best feel you can trust. Anything you do is a calculated risk, so you just have to use your best judgement about who you can work with on what. I try to know when to keep my mouth shut. I don't just let anyone in on my politics, because I know that makes me vulnerable. If I'm working with people who might be working on other stuff, I don't ask too many questions about what they might be getting into. I don't want to know. 

Now all of this is apart from run of the mill organizing activities. Use discretion, but if what you are doing is by and large on the straight and narrow, I wouldn't worry too much about it. There are gonna be cops and informants that make their way into any open organization. Just be wary of making personal alliances with people inside these organizations who are very open about pushing the envelope in risky ways. 
-----==----==---==-----
I don't have a lot of personal experience, but from reading on the subject, identifying an infiltrator can really be tricky, and trying to spot and out one without good evidence does the state's job for it.  One solution might be to focus on behavior, as opposed to identity.  So, for example, if someone you don't know very well is saying you should team up with them to do some serious illegal shit, it doesn't really matter if they're a state agent trying to entrap you, or just plain stupid; they're putting you at risk and ought to be avoided.  "Here is a very basic fact about people who are genuine armed struggle types. They act alone or in very small groups of trusted friends. Genuine illegals do not go around blabbing and do not casually recruit people." ([Source](http://porkupineblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/agent-provocateurs-spies-and-how-to.html))  "[Why Misogynists Make Great Informants](http://inciteblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/15/why-misogynists-make-great-informants-how-gender-violence-on-the-left-enables-state-violence-in-radical-movements/)" has some good perspective on how disruptive (and, in this article, especially sexist) acts damage the movement whether or not the person in question is a state agent.

Also, security culture isn't necessarily about smoking out informants, but in limiting the damage they can cause.  When we don't share info with people who don't need to know it - or ask about details we don't need to know - we can make the job of spying a hell of a lot harder.

Ok, and I know I started out saying I don't really know how to spot a spy, but I will say that, based on recent undercover cases against both radical leftists and radical islamist folks, one thing that seems common is that the targets will be relatively young and/or inexperienced.  People who have never done so much as an act of property destruction get swept up in/pressured into a plot hatched by someone they haven't known that long and has way more "cred" to do something seriously illegal and/or violent.

Admittedly, many attempts at Anarchist revolution have been co-opted or shut down by external forces. I think it would be worth pointing out to these people that anarchism, or something very close to it has been the dominant political structure for almost all of human history. Many tribal societies have what could be considered an anarchist or at least communist structure. This existed from somewhere between 40,000 - 150,000 years. The nation state (which is thinks of when they think of government) has existed for less than 500 years. Therein lies the other angle which you can approach this from. Forms of government as labels, such as empire, city-state, nation, kingdom, people, etc. have usually been determined by modern historians. Yes, Rome was an empire, and due to obvious cultural and historical ties it was very similar to a proto-european nation state. However, legality, taxes, identity and other commonly items commonly associated with the state functioned in many ways that are much different from the all controlling nation-state. These differences are fascinating and paint a much more fluid portrait of human society's structure than people imagine. Anarchism is nothing if not fluid. 

This does not mean I am equating Anarchism with the historically fluid transformations of government. Moving forward from these points I think it is worthwhile to think about the nature of government that you think anarchism supports. Anarchism, because of its community focus and because of modern communications technology might function very well for a long time as a set-up of city-"states" or federated communities. This I think fits much closer to the nature of traditional human societies and has the potential to be more long-lasting than a state or centralized government.
-----==----==---==-----
good question. i think about this one a lot myself. 

as long as the community wishes to remain free and unoppressed, there will be groups, unions, organizations, and in a time of reaction and defense, a militia, that will do whatever they are willing to and can do to retain their autonomy. 

im sure there is more to this argument, but tbh i'm not too familar with it. 

try posting your question to /r/anarchy101. the people over there are generally well-versed in any arguments for and against anarchy. 
-----==----==---==-----
&gt; How do I combat this argument?

With great difficulty. 

Some kinds of work give more social power (ie decision-making ability for a group) than others thanks to the division of labor and economies of scale, and of course the inherent or assumed worth of the work. People will exploit this differential. The kind of people who exploit it the best are simultaneously the people who end up with the most power and also the people we least want in charge of anything, to paraphrase the classics.

Perhaps this is just a a problem of construction, and that a socio-economic set-up that avoids *implied* hierarchies even as it abolishes explicit ones is possible.

However there is the problem of dealing with freeloading (which, if left unchecked, destroys the capacity to provide the good or service in the first place). The various collaborative democratic methods for dealing with this existential issue, IMO, will mean rational institutional responses that incorporate systems of control. I honestly can't see any way to avoid this, and that's why I'm not an anarchist.
-----==----==---==-----
People would need to agree on some non-coercive (or minimally coercive) system that would be highly decentralized and controlled from below, designed specifically to prevent the problem you described. Administrative work and process facilitation must be shared.  Everyone must be able to take a turn helping run the process if they want to. 

We should steer away from the idea that anarchism is chaos, disorder, or disorganization. A successful anarchist society would have to be highly organized. The system should be designed to prevent an accumulation of excess power in any one group or individual. 

Anarchism does not mean no rules, but maybe means no rulers. Without a clearly understood and accepted process, people and groups will accumulate power to themselves exactly as you question discusses.

To put it more plainly: At the beginning of your anarchism, get everyone together and say OK guys we need to come up with a transparent, non-coercive process that will make sure we all have power in community decisions and will keep any one person from getting excessive power. And then proceed to do it.


-----==----==---==-----
This is simple. The imposition is upon the claimant to prove the claim. So, in this case, it is incumbent upon the person claiming that a governing body will be born out of anarchism to back the claim with evidence. If there is zero evidence, there should be no reason to accept the claim. They should cite historical examples of this happening. If the argument is fair, all of the evidence will necessarily match the claim, if not the claim is false.

The first line of the article: "If this Harvard University **student** got her way..." Emphasis mine.

Yeah, that's a far as we need to read. Who gives a fuck what a student says---especially an undergraduate? Much more often than not, undergraduates are idiots who hold ridiculous views. Reporting on what a student says and then titling the article "Harvard writer says..." is the worst kind of journalism. I'm sure I could hang out on Yale's campus for a few days and overhear some student say that women who dress evocatively are somewhat responsible for being raped. And then I could write an article: "Yale Speaker Says Women Responsible for Being Raped" and we would all click on it.

-----==----==---==-----
the mainstream of American politics has taken a creepy authoritarian bent after its been revealed that the buerocrats have been doing creepy authoritarian stuff all along, and it seems like they need to work up justification.

When the conservatives lost big in elections they came out questioning democracy, and before the liberals won, they did the same.

If you want to know what kind of creepy orwellian assholes lurk in mainstream politics, you don't have to go beyond reddit, go into a mainstream sub like /r/politics, or some other frontpage shit, and you see people openly talk about ways of lying and decieving the public for their political masters, and utter contempt they have for people who aren't %100 behind their faction. They feel everyone else are the ones brainwashed, and they need to be tricked and duped into submission, for their own good.

When you point out the obvious provable gaps between their own ideaology, and their choice of institutions, as provable by things like voting records(which are online btw), etc, they get mad, like its all some form of conspiracy against them.

We are not talking about anyone with extremist political doctrinal views. We are talking about people with extremist views on preserving the status quo. These people, combined with the government, combined with the corporate power, that generally backs them, and more or less sponsers their speach is what scares me.

Not scares me on a political level, but on a personal level. They've reduced themselves to the level of gang members, and it scares me, they might be in the right mind to come after me.

You make a mistake in thinking that schools exist to educate.  Modern schools exist to indoctrinate people into submitting to the system, and possibly give them some sort of skill that they can use to produce for the system.

The questions you raise are valid ones, but they can all be answered with a single answer...Schools exist to make people subservient to authority, not to actually teach people things.


-----==----==---==-----
As currently organized, universities are credentialing organizations. A degree is, for better or worse, a certificate that the student has gained some level of expertise in a specific field of study. The "worse" side of all of that is that the widespread need for the credential means that there are lots of students who probably really wouldn't study without all the formal structures, while, of course, the credentialing process can't do without at least some of them. 

Youtube lectures probably *aren't* more efficient for the sort of learning that isn't simply credentialing. The only way that the *investigating with* really happens is through interaction. My experience over a couple of decades on both sides of the teacher's desk is that student interest in exploration has actually declined considerably. Even in programs where exploration is presumably a key concern, there has been a tendency for most of the flexibility in the classroom to be eliminated. It's probably not any surprise that education in a capitalist society is largely a product, rather than a process, and there is a lot of pressure to reduce the experience to a well-defined commodity. Much of that, unfortunately, comes from the consumers, the students.

Less efficient. MOOCs have extremely low pass rates. They're good if you want to get as many bums on seats as possible, extracting maximum profit from applicants, though.

&gt; Why do academic departments arbitrarily decide what topics certain courses will or will not cover? Should they not give students more control over the topics covered?

&gt; Why do universities kick students out for not conforming to their ideologies?

You were probably kicked out for writing bad essays.

&gt; Why don't universities focus more on teaching students to educate themselves? (The internet is a source of infinite knowledge if you know how to use it correctly)

They do do that.

Interesting trajectory. New Labour restyled themselves as a right-centre party, winning a landslide victory. This in turn inspired the Swedish Social Democrats to try the same thing. However, they were beaten to the goal by the Swedish conservatives, who went even further in adopting the strategy of Blair: "The Swedish Moderate Party provocatively called themselves the “new worker’s party” in the 2006 elections, referencing their campaign theme of creating jobs by cutting taxes (the party in government at the time was the Social Democratic Worker’s party, a party that has dominated Swedish politics for most of the 20th century).

In the elections of 2010, which the Moderates also won, the tone became even more confident and daring: they now were “Sweden’s only worker’s party“."

And now it all has come full circle, with the Tories following the example set by the Nya Moderaterna, who in turn were inspired by New Labour. 

And not one of all these bastards represent the interests of the working class in any real sense... sweet world, this.

In the USA they've been doing this since the late 1970s, with the whole Joe Sixpack, "blue collar" image thingy. The worst part, is that no one on the left moved a muscelle to get the "blue collar" types back.

While I'll admit that many are blowing the neo-fascist presence out of proportion, I wouldn't quite say that these protests are truly about "liberty and freedom" in any sort of egalitarian sense...they are more about "liberty and freedom" in a democratic capitalist sense.

Ukrainians aren't protesting because they wan't to topple authority.  They are protesting to be dominated by a "nicer" authority.
-----==----==---==-----
Then why would they have repealed the new language laws? That did not look like something promoting Liberty and Freedom, it looked an intentional attempt at insulting the Russian speaking South and East of the country.
-----==----==---==-----
Horrible article. If fascists are truly not part of the protest, surely there would be a way to find arguments for that. This article is attacking people who say that there are without giving a single argument for why there aren't. I'm not saying that *I* know exactly what's going on, but it seems like neither does the author of this article. 

And by the way, where is all that russian propaganda? Every single piece of news I've read or seen (here in the EU) is extremely pro-EU and in favor of the protestors. But apparently my view is distorted by all sorts of russian propaganda, and I'd really like to know where we are supposed to get that.

I have never personally looked into it myself, but I have become involved with an NPO recently and remember myself thinking that it felt at least a little more anarchic than most similar organizations (radio station, in case you were wondering). I'm also in the US. 

In fact, my ex works for an animal shelter that is non-profit. They pay employees, care for animals, renovate, advertise, etc., all through donations. 

I'm sorry, I guess I have very little to offer this conversation, but have an upvote so that we can get some additional input (hopefully).
-----==----==---==-----
Can I ask why you're so focused on starting a non-profit, specifically, as opposed to starting an organization while being agnostic to what legal forms it takes?  While a 501 org can be very useful for some types of activity (especially charity, working within or quasi-within the system, etc), they're not necessarily always the best form for anarchist projects.  The rules governing 501 status and anarchist organizing principles may well be in conflict (tax-exempt status requires, I believe, some sort of board of directors). All 501s definitely *cannot* "engage in politics unhindered under the 1st amendment;" there are different classifications for different types of political activity and rules about what each different type of organization can and cannot do.

The main reasons I can think to go 501 status have to do with money.  So, say you start a radical bookshop, and start renting a space as a storefront.  Honestly, you might be able to get by for a while just being cash based and paying rent, but eventually you may need to stop being sketchy and form some sort of legal entity, and a 501 might be the way to go.  Or, if you want to get grant money for something, you'll have a lot more opportunities organized as a 501.  But they don't exactly give out grants for smashing the state and capitalism ;).

All this is leaving aside the totally shitty role the "Non-Profit Industrial Complex" plays in the US.  From an anarchist perspective, my default is to want to organize outside of those structures, unless they are the best available solution to a specific organizational need.


-----==----==---==-----
My friends and I are in the process of starting an NPO. Right now we have some land in TN that we are trying to make into a sustainable living space and base of operations for the NPO. The actual work we do, though still being explored, will relate to providing educational materials for free, with an emphasis on education in DIY tech/science and sustainability (but will also include more traditional topics). Everything is very up in the air right now.

An interesting thing to note about organizing a 501(c)(3): They sort of force you to select board members so that there can be accountability. Which, in turn, forces a heirarchical structure on the ogranization. So it seems like we're going to have to have a "president" and "vice-president" but the positions will rotate and be largely nominal.   
-----==----==---==-----
I don't know much about the legal aspects, but what about a [worker's cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative)? 

Seems like this approach would offer more flexibility and hopefully help maintain a more anarchist methodology.

It should probably be titled "Anarchists Building *Popular* Power in Chile".  Anarchists want regular working class people to have power over their own lives.  We not not want an anarchist minority to seize power.  We want to empower the dis-empowered.
-----==----==---==-----
What involvement has there been by the CNT and other anarchist groups?
-----==----==---==-----
Are you still in contact with people from that period? What are they doing now? What happened to the movement after the occupations moved on?

A group of us that were involved in Occupy here in New Zealand are making an [open-source tool](http://www.loomio.org) for group decision-making inspired by the collective processes used by the Indignados and Occupy. We have large user groups in Spain, such as the Pirate Party there, and the tool is available in Spanish. If it would be useful to any groups you know still trying to self-organize, please let them know about it.

How can I join a squat in Barcelona?
-----==----==---==-----
Just post it, this should be interesting!

As for questions, well, I was actually in the country around the time, so I was pretty aware of what was going on, but I'm not sure what has happened with the movement since? Any updates?
-----==----==---==-----
I thought I'd just give my opinion about the movement as it definitely warrants some criticism. I think that, as with OWS, it was great for raising awareness. This was a seriously popular uprising (popular in the sense that a HUGE amount of people were involved). I remember classes at the university down the street from the plaza were cancelled and nearly everyone filed out of the uni into the plaza. So there was really a valuable first step into a renewed popular struggle that in the context of Spanish history, hadn't taken place in a while. The assemblies were also very impressive and resulted in a list of issues that were created with direct democracy (megaphones and hands in the air).

Someone else wrote recently that a significant thing that happened with OWS was that it shattered the average protester's illusion of a benevolent state apparatus. I believe the same to be the case with los indignados. It was seriously a nation scandal the way that the police violently suppressed dissent. There was miniscule support for it from anywhere in the media. 

["Democracia Real Ya" ("Real democracia now")](http://www.democraciarealya.es/) was the main organizer. They can be compared to the formalized organization of OWS. I criticize this groups as being a pretty benign (read: ineffective) force. They are reformists and don't really represent workers. This is why I think that they aren't closely aligned with CNT/FAI etc. 

Many of the agitators in recent years seek to return to the [pre-Spanish Civil war republican system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic) which I think is not a terrible idea. It was under that system that worker's ownership of factories and collectivization were made feasible, though they were not necessarily prioritized. The current system, like pretty much all of Europe, now prioritizes neoliberal objectives (EU integration for example). As a whole, however, I think that waving the red yellow and purple second republic flag is kind of just a kind of nostalgic longing for a sense of justice associated with pre-Franco Spain. Also, Democracia Real Ya advocates for "active non-violent resistance" which I can't decide if I think is *actually* effective. 
-----==----==---==-----
I fear these systems will be strengthened and their resolve steeled by the lack of public reaction, that's the whole reason these systems are highly classified in the first place.

A few years ago, I built my bike from scratch at a co-op, but lately have been paying for tune-ups at a bike shop instead because I have no free time! I also have a laptop (at least it runs Linux though!) I am basically the worst lifestyle anarchist there is. 
-----==----==---==-----
I have some bourgeois luxuries that I hate to own like electronics, but I do try my best at getting  most things in my home second hand or made by local crafters. Although I have a growing antique and oddity collection that, while actually worthless, cost more to acquire than needed. And tattoos. I appreciate the art of well done tattoos as much as stick and pokes, and that runs up a bill... If anything I feel more guilty about some cleaning supplies I have that aren't vegan and the roach poison/exterminator I needed to get. 

But roaches, man. Shit could make ya sick! I am more effective alive.

Been working in fine dining for 5 years. Been an anarchist for a little over a year.

Except the self-employed and members of coops own the means of production, but aren't capitalists.
-----==----==---==-----
If you redefine 'accurate' to mean 'wildly oversimplified', then yes.  Otherwise, eh...

Black and white dialectic thinking is inevitably bullshit propaganda, a call to arms around entrenched ideological lines which utterly ignores the concepts of compromise or the promise of innovative solutions.

There are those who are working very hard to make the basic means of production of both media and physical items birthright and ubiquitous as a way of undermining the advantage of the capital holding class.  This reality stumps the idealism of the quiz quite handedly.
-----==----==---==-----
This is wildly over simplified and does not examine accurately the intricacies of the class system. It does not take race/ethnicity as social constructs into account, nor religion, nor gender or sexual orientation. Social class is not black and white, it is a gradient. It also reduces all oppression to economic oppression, and only considers class position rather than position, sympathy, and loyalty. 

TL;DR: this is too simplistic to be accurate
-----==----==---==-----
hillariously simple and stupid, doing little if anything to quantify "means of production"
-----==----==---==-----
I aim to own my own press. This don't make me a capitalist because I don't intend to make any money out of the business. Except maybe some to survive, but not to dominate some publishing world and become uber rich.

-----==----==---==-----
No mainstream media has reported on the violence on the protesters. People lost eyes, got broken jaws and noses, because the police was firing flash balls straight in the crowd. 
All reports from people that actively participated in the protest lead to the conclusion that the police presence led to the confrontation. Those '1000" radicals were none other than the protesters getting showered in gas.

Now what's very interesting is that the bourgeois media is trying very hard to divide the protesters in two groups. They are trying to antagonize the activists squatting the airport construction zone and the people ready to fight back the repression.

But its not working because all the non radicals taking part in all the anti airport actions are seeing that the traditional liberal methods cannot solve this issue. Its a radicalizing movement, and you can be sure more and more of those 20'000 people will be joining the anarchists.

-----==----==---==-----
This is excellent news to hear, however I was wondering if a similar study had be conducted for those in less developed regions of the world such as parts of Africa or Asia for example. Even without this supporting information though this is a serious blow to the "common wisdom" that hierarchical modes of production are the most efficient means of generating wealth.
-----==----==---==-----
Well... depends on who you pay it to. Housing cooperatives are a thing, and rich people don't see any of that money. It goes into upkeep, the repair pot, new construction, or possibly to pay off a loan. The loan part isn't ideal, but a magnitude better than profits on rent, as loans can be paid off for good.
-----==----==---==-----

Rent is the secret. Tax the wealthy, charge the poor!

I like to think of myself as reasonable person and my political thoughts usually tend toward many anarchist ideologies, but this idea seems rather shallow to me.  If you don't want to pay rent, buy yourself a house or at least build one.  Sometimes anarchy reeks of self - entitlement.  For example,  "Housing should be a right, not a  luxury!".  Okay, then who should pay for and build the houses for everyone?   The government?   Hippies and self subscribed anarchists always seem to want to share your stuff, they never seem to want to share their own things.

No, everyone does what they think is right because if they did not do that they find themselves wanting for righteousness. Yes alignment in games can be traced over a political compass, but it's not the same. Conservatives can have a moral compass that sends them down a 'Paragon' path of good righteous actions when it comes to saving lives, fighting opression and correcting injustice; If the same game asks them to tell a man he must give up his inherited watermill because the people downriver want to use it instead of allow him to make money from it they will choose a different answer than you and me as Anarchists (we demand he give his mill to those who need it more than they; conservatives tell the people downriver to get fucked).

It's a bit too much generalization; there are better 3D political compass'. 
-----==----==---==-----
There's no objective basis for the morality axis of it, so sure, for you this might reflect your analysis of the world, but I would think that likewise, Neo-cons and Neo-Nazis would see themselves as Lawful Good and the Leninists as Lawful Evil. And I'm sure the "an"caps see anarcho-communism as essentially a chaotic evil bandit ideology. Chaotic Good folk heroes like Robin Hood look one way to us, and another to the empire. In my campaigns, the Paladins are just as likely to be Nazi-Crusaders as liberal do-gooders, because each of them wants to portray themselves as for Justice and Law. I find this far more accurate and far more fun for role-playing.  
-----==----==---==-----
I used to really be into two-dimensional political spectra like Nolan and Political Compass. It's an interesting idea, but IMHO it's more useful to organize ideologies into a Venn diagram of Liberalism - Socialism - Conservatism.
-----==----==---==-----
I know in DND, that anarchists are usually chaotic neutral. But the problem with comparing alignment (which is essentially morality and how you handle moral dilemmas) with politics, is pretty subjective. A Neo-nazi is gonna see himself as a good guy and would rate himself something good, where an anarchist would put him as evil something.

Pedophilia-defense is the logical conclusion of the "men's rights activism" bullshit that festers on reddit. Now I'm sure some MRA will respond here, maybe even some MRA-bot with 100 shitty links, they're like the Scientologists of reddit, panopticon in gaze and lurking in demeanor, scanning the horizon for opportunities to advance their phallusophy.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't know I'd be interested to listen to a pedophile and ~~his~~ their worldview...
-----==----==---==-----
It doesn't seem nice or good in any way, but does it concern this subreddit specifically and if so, how?
-----==----==---==-----
I'm for universal standards of treatment and I don't think it's acceptable to harass anyone for anything.

That said, it'd be ignorant to think that the level of repercussion for an exposed pedophile and an exposed exhibitionist would be comparable, except that both will regret the exposure.  Pedophiles aren't treated as human in our society, and few people would shed a tear if one were subjected to violent vigilantism.  We live in a society where "Kill Your Local Pedophile" is an acceptable bumper sticker.

I also have to point out that people thought it was ok to out that one guy with all the creepy sex subs, and iirc, Gawker was all for that.  So if we're concerned for human decency, we really can't cherry pick like this.  Either it's ok to out everyone for harassment - which maybe Gawker's trying to argue for, dunno.  However, it seems like they're arguing against allowing people to post female users' nudes to other threads so I'm not sure if their position is egalitarian or not.

The takeaway here should be that we respect everyone's right to segment their online persona, even if they don't take care to do it themselves with throwaways, etc.
-----==----==---==-----
Please avoid this type of sites, they are horrible, you can self post with the links, I don't know, but anything from this network.

Also, reddit, as a site, does not implement any control over the sub reddits, this means, that they don't tell mods what to do, they are free in their own little subs. Even in the "main" ones. 

We should be remind that the sub reddit niggars, a racist pit hole of hell, was banned for vote manipulation, and not for its calls to violence nor anything like that. Same with that MRA sub about how women should be physically assaulted (with videos), or the red pill that tries to sell the BS that women are incapable of real emotions, etc.... 



reddit's administration will not take action, this is the sad true. This is a free harbor for any one to say what ever they want, good, bad, offensive, or what ever. Best you can do, participate in the good subs, and un subscribe and avoid the "bad ones". 


To what many have said, that this does not fit in this sub, I agree; this is some sensationalize internet drama. Trying to attack reddit, for what a mod does? That's dumb.

Mental abuse from my family and the schooling system of my country made me reject the world I was brought up in. After making my first friend in years, he got me into green anarchism. After seeing the destructive forces of capitalism on the ecosystems around my community, I knew from that day forward that a radical viewpoint would be the only thing capable of destroying the monster that runs this world.

I have always had problems with authority, and always hated commercialism. I was always finding ways to fuck with my principal in school, and going out of my way to metaphorically shit on fashion and consumerism. Not entirely sure why, but having issues with authority and commercialism doesn't necessarily make you an anarchist. I met my first real anarchist in Occupy, and was always kind of curious, if not cautious at first. I got to be friends with many of them, and realized by and large, they were sweethearts.

After the eviction, I was kind of heart broken, so I took a break from politics and activism for a bit. When I decided my life was pretty bland without it, I immediately thought of the anarchists I had met at Occupy, and how impassioned they were. So I decided to forget all of my assumptions about anarchism, and give the ideology the benefit of the doubt. I started with Emma Goldman. Early in the book I read, she attacked the dominion of religion, rather aggressively. I'm a staunch atheist, and so this resonated with me, and that's kind of when one half clicked: If I don't need a god telling me what's right, then I sure as hell don't need a government telling me. The Communist Manifesto introduced me to left-wing economics, but it wasn't until I read Kropotkin that I was sold.

Now I'm a member of the IWW. I hang out at local anarchist spots, and try and build projects to better the community.

I'm an anarchist because we only borrow this world from our children. 
-----==----==---==-----
From a young age I felt there was something very wrong with the world, even if I didn't have the knowledge to understand what was wrong or the vocabulary to express it. I gravitated towards Marxism from an early age and in high school read the Communist Manifesto and Das Capital (in English), I joined a radical youth Marxist group in my home town and started getting into radical politics. The older I got and the more I read, the more I started to distrust the state and pretty much everything to do with it. Marxists were no help, many of them professing respect and admiration for what I considered to be ruthless murdering dictators, and I quickly grew apart from my old political friends, finding my own road while many of my old comrades either joined in less radical politics or left politics entirely.

The problem with having spent a large amount of my youth among Marxists was the anti-anarchist propaganda I was subjected too, mainly driven by ignorance of what Anarchy actually means. It was only when I by chance picked up Orwell's "Homage to Catalonia" that I started to question what I'd been led to believe was Anarchism.

I was quite demoralized for a long time, politically speaking, but the more I read the more I identified with the morals and ideals of the Anarchist movement. Yet due to still being unsure about myself and politics in general, I stayed away from other anarchists.

Now fifteen years later and a lot of reading about the subject, I can say that any time someone starts claiming that I or someone else who's part of our community isn't a real anarchist, they will either need to have a very good reason for their claim or I will start kindly but firmly urging them to educate themselves on what it is they claim to know.

Many reasons, some more abstract than others.  It was a gradual transition over a few years.  American Liberal -&gt; state socialist -&gt; libertarian socialist -&gt; anarchist.  The entire time I considered myself a transhumanist, in actuality I am a transhumanist first and an anarchist second.  I believe the two are inextricably linked and am actively working on composing an in depth work on anarcho-transhumanism, since it appears that none exist as yet.

I believe an anarchist society and anarcho-syndicalist ideals present the best socio-political structures for maximizing human well being in the foreseeable future.  The only way we can have a truly transhumanist society is if *all* people are free to pursue the lifestyle of their choosing, experiments in living as J.S. Mill would put it.

Ultimately, anarchism is the inevitable result of the fullest expression of values which the vast majority of people claim to hold.  Well being over profit, liberty over authority, and it synthesizes the seemingly mutually exclusive ideals of individualism and community.  Any compromise on these ideals will inevitably backslide towards a totalitarian society, so they must be held to with the utmost vigor.

**tl;dr** Anarchism is the ideology which holds the greatest promise to ensure that every person on this planet can live a fulfilling life.

Growing disillusion with both the state and capitalism after the '08 recession hit. Was a libertarian for awhile but realized that it was more or less incompatible with my [religious beliefs](http://www.uua.org/beliefs/principles/). My dad always talked about not putting a band-aid on problems and fixing the root of the problem. I discovered that both the State and Capitalism were the problem.  
-----==----==---==-----
I'm an anarchist because there is no justification for the state and no justification for the exploitation of human beings. I never was anything else really, when i was young i never really understood authority or why it existed, i never liked being told what to do, what to think, and what to feel by the people around me. I used to get the shit kicked out of me for that. I became an anarchist by listening to Anarcho-punk, atleast thats when i first identified as an anarchist and over time i just became more and more involved in the politics and the music. Then i started reading into the literature, then i listened to Noam Chomsky for the first time. After that i started getting pretty serious about anarchism and just kept getting involved with it. I think most people are anarchists, they just don't know it yet.

We're like dust - everywhere, and you can't get rid of us. I love this about anarchism. People all over the world come to these conclusions just by observing the world around them. For me, it was growing up in war-torn ex-Yugoslavia, and seeing how empty were the promises of the demagogues offering a better future, every 4 years on and on. We voted for one after the other - mostly you voted for one party not out of support, but just so the other party wouldn't win. And now we're here where we are. At least 1/3 unemployed. Power concentrated in the hands of a criminal elite, with new scandals popping up everyday - an incompetent elite made up of lying, uneducated and uncaring scum. And the war that made them rich made those who fought it paupers. You have real-life heroes digging through trash cans for food or for recyclable plastic bottles, knowing that all they have lost, they have lost in vain. Finally, you have the 'future' - us. The new meat - everyone under 30. Ask a high-schooler if they're gonna stay in the country or work abroad. A majority wants to go away. So, is it better to be a foreigner someplace else all your life or to remain in your own, thousand year old poverty? It doesn't matter, there's no future for this 'future'. The only way we could possibly build it is if every last one of the fuckers who robbed us, who engineered the war for personal profit and gain - and mind you, the same ones are in the parliament and have been for 20 years -, if they all disappeared. 

But they're not going to just go away. I'm an anarchist because I'm an optimist. I believe we can make them go away. I say fuck your wars and your hate and your profit and power and fuck your lies and dishonesty. This is a personal story with nothing and everything personal in it. Because it's not just mine but everyone's out here. Because of all this fucked up shit, I'm an anarchist.

I've just started reading *Free Women of Spain: Anarchism and the struggle for the Emancipation of Women* by Martha A. Ackelsberg. The beginning describes the testimonies of some women who joined the Mujeres Libres.

I personally started out as an atheist keyboard warrior shithead. I'm sure many can sympathise; you think you're an independently minded rebel, so you start looking for that kind of literature (Age of Reason --&gt; Reason.com, Penn Jilette). Through that process, I became a US libertarian, then an AnCap (this transition was stimulated by Austrian "economics"). After nearly being sucked into the Freedomain Radio cult, I withdrew to seriously reconsider my politics. In 2012 I went to China, where I saw real poverty and gained some social concern. Two months later I was in Barcelona, where the history of the Anarchists was covertly written in every street cobble. There I visited an anarchist bookshop which opened my mind to real anarchism. So from there I became a mutualist, then an anarcho-syndicalist and now an anarchist communist.

I blame the internet.
-----==----==---==-----
From a upper middle class background, my parents lean pretty far to the right hand political spectrum (but being swedish that would still be leftish). Had a great upbringing, went to school with people who are quite wealthy, straight As student, polite and well-mannered... You get the general idea.

Don't get me wrong, I love my family and childhood friends to death, but sometimes I just get so furious at how closeminded and egoistic their opinions are. 

Was really torn politically during most of my teenage years. On one hand I agree with the individualistic attitude that I has brought up with; I believe in hard work, and independence. On the other hand, that attitude can be so selfish. Many people from the upper classes seem to forget how priviledged they are. It's *easier* to get somewhere in society when your parents have money, than it is if you have a working class bakground. And that is not a society that I want to support. So I obviously rejected the Right . But I couldn't really relate to the Left either. I agree with the solidarity and equality aspect of it, but the leftish parties seems to want to solve everything by welfare. Because throwing money at the problem will fix it, right? To me, that's focusing on the symtom, instead to treating the disease. 

Went for social liberalism for a while, but I don't know, it just didn't feel right.

Then, around the age of 18, I read *The Dispossesed* by Ursula K. Le Guin and it was like something clicked. Started reading a lot of anarchist writing (Kropotkin, Goldman, Bakunin, Proudhon etc.) and everything just fell into place. This was what I had been looking for. And like that, I just fell head over heels in love with anarchism. Right now I just feel like going on a rant about how amazing it is, but I don't think I need to convince you guys. The amazing part is how it combines the individual with the collective; how it starts from the bottom nurturing the individual, focusing on its relationships with other individuals in a non-hierarchical way, and thus creates a society built on mutual trust and solidarity. 

The world is such a beautiful place. It's a shame that most people never get to experience that since the priviledged classes feel that they have the right to keep it to themselves and exploit it. What's fucking wrong with sharing?

I was very idealistic child, raised in a Christian household. I really believed in the principles of truth and equality and loving everybody and being inclusive and sharing and, you know, like Jesus was. In elementary school the other kids used to have me mediate their conflicts, and I felt good being trusted and being able to help.All my report card comments are about my sense of fair play. Not to brag or anything, I just want to illustrate how much this mattered to 5 year old me.

Flash forward about 6 years. Moved to a new town after I finally tell my parents my grandmother had been abusing me for years. Don't get along with kids because I'm too much of a goody goody. We clash. They kill my pet cat. They hacked his ears off and gutted him and left him on my doorstep. I was, and quite honestly still am 10 years after the fact, devastated by the loss of my pet and friend. But they got away with it. Nobody gave a flying fuck about me in that town.

I decided there could be no God if he let this happen.If God was supposed to be fair, what the everloving fuck was this? And I decided that any system that allowed my cat to be murdered and forgotten wasn't fair. Any system that let my grandmother get away with child abuse wasn't fair, and therefore I couldn't support it.

My isolation from my town gave me a lot of time to read. I graduated into more historical non-fiction and essays in Grade 11. By then my views had evolved beyond criminal justice system= unfair, but I had thought that I was just stuck in the system, and if I wanted a decent life and knew what was good for me, I'd go to school, get married and move to the suburbs. Living outside this system was some kind of far off dream.

I happened upon Emma Goldman while stuck in a Wikipedia read-a-thon. From there I found the anarchist library. I was so fucking relieved to find people who were able to put into words what I had always felt and thought, but could never express correctly-and then to find out there were many, many anarchists and they were people I could relate to and who shared a value system.  I am happy to see there were still some good people around.
Anarchism is, to me, the logical conclusion to my beliefs about fairness,inclusion and equality for all.

I don't like myths. I get how they work, and I think that that's pretty cool,  but I think that every myth needs to be destroyed. Rational enlightenment is the goal. The state fuels itself on myth, as does capitalism.
-----==----==---==-----
I came to it through my experience with institutions. I hated high school, I hated the standardization, the conformity through social pressure and ostracization, the crushing of creativity and the submission to authority. I hated being told what, when and how to learn and if I stepped out of line, I was punished. It actually took me quite awhile to undue some of the psychological damage done from the school system. I got a job when I was 16 and to my shock and dismay I realized that the workplace was setup in the exact same fashion. That society was setup in the exact same fashion. That I was a cog in a giant inhumane machine. 

Lucky for me in my last year of high school I failed a class with an English teacher who at least try to challenge us with alternative thinking, in that class I read an Adbusters that had a quote from Chomsky that intrigued me. That first summer out of school I picked a copy of Understanding Power that I happened to stumble upon in my local used bookstore, that book gave me some context to what I was feeling about our society. It actually saved me a lot of existential misery. It allowed me to counter that popular culture meme that states that war, violence and inequality are somehow "natural". That I wasn't crazy for feeling the way I felt, that it was society and culture warped by the unnatural forces of Capitalism and the State that was fucked up. 

I've read quite a bit of political philosophy but I always comeback to Anarchist thought. The problem in my mind has always been the question of power and what it does to people and institutions.

My story isn't interesting, but [Conspiracy to Riot in the Furtherance of Terrorism: Collective Autobiography of the RNC 8](http://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-Riot-Furtherance-Terrorism-Autobiography/dp/1936900181) is a good group of autobiographies by the group of anarchists that organized the demonstration at the 2008 RNC. It goes deeply into their background and why they became anarchists, the group was fairly diverse and had different backgrounds. 
-----==----==---==-----
For as long as I can remember I have had problems with authority. I had trouble with teachers, coaches, parents, police officers, military officers, anyone in a position of authority. I still find it very difficult to do what I am told. The only reason I have a job is because I am good at what I do so people tend to stay out of my way and let me do my thing. When they don't, I have to find another job.

So, I have always been an anarchist in terms of disliking and wanting to abolish all forms of hierarchy.

I have always been fascinated by science. I saw it as a meritocracy where ideas ruled instead of people. I ended up studying biology at my university because I wanted to figure out how to protect the environment.

I eventually learned capitalism was the source of environmental destruction. I didn't like capitalism but I had no idea there were better alternatives.

A good friend lent me The Monkey Wrench Gang by Edward Abbey. I deeply admired Earth First and this book was my gateway from environmentalism toward anarchism's social and economic philosophy (before that I didn't know anarchism meant anything more than being anti-hierarchy).

I eventually found Kropotkin and I was hooked.
-----==----==---==-----
I'd suggest reading about the Transition Movement and Rob Hopkins.  Not explicitly anarchist, but very heavy on direct action.

Now for my own boring story:

As a child, I was rather sensitive, empathetic, and very concerned about the environment. I was endlessly curious, and often demanded to know *why* I was supposed to do something.  As a male child in a rural, southern US town, these were all unacceptable traits.  They were bullied out of me - mostly by schoolmates, often by teachers, and sometimes by my mother.  Coupled with the public school system's inability to deal with "gifted/talented" children and few other options for any kind of stimulation in my small town, I felt oppressed, trapped, and bored.  

I escaped into books.  My father, a lifelong educator and minister, encouraged my appetite for books, and steeped me in historical, political, and sometimes religious texts.  At some point, I started paying attention to current events.  After my dad's effective training in critical thinking, reading about my "representatives" just made me angry, pessimistic, and extremely cynical (well Hell, that hasn't changed much).  Well before I could vote, I had determined that I didn't really care to.

I must also note that I grew up Christian fundamentalist, but that worldview was shattered in much the same way my inbred American conservatism was - by blatant and celebrated hypocrisy (as Gandhi said, "I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians").

I spent probably seven years - some of high school, and nearly all of my college and graduate career - seeking some coherent worldview that allowed me my faith and a way for the human race to move forward.  I had just about given up; I had compartmentalized my current and conflicting political and religious views, and was mostly ok with that.  Then I started serious work on my master's thesis.

I was studying, though in a somewhat roundabout way, housing.  Through my research I came to realize how devastating a system capitalism is for a necessity as simple as shelter.  The writings of John F C Turner led me to Colin Ward, who was more or less my formal introduction to anarchist philosophy.  I had found what I felt was the right language to describe my concerns with the system as it is.

In studying varieties of anarchism (separate from my thesis), I read about Christian anarchism.  Intrigued, I picked up a copy of Tolstoy's *The Kingdom of God is Within You*.  And I read many of the same critiques, based in religion, I had often made of Church and State, as independent entities and together.

Best of all, it all came together and clicked.  As a Christian anarchist, I can describe my faith in political terms, and my politics in religious terms.  I am of a single mind - no more compartmentalizing religion and politics.  I can and do fully throw my mind and body into actions because I can now fully believe in something.
-----==----==---==-----
The majority of my life I remember most of begins in my teens. I was a naive thinker as a child although I did find myself broken away from the norms.

I was bullied as a child and wanted to kill myself many times.

I was ostracized and taught that I wasn't normal. Well I ain't but that is an amazing fact I love about myself now.

I was taught that mainstream music sucked because it wasn't Christian. So I went against the grain many times as a kid decrying people's choice in music. Meanwhile I had a secret fetish for Iron Maiden.

I basically had a break from my Christian upbringing because of several different factors that led me slowly away from regurgitating opinions to being the best critical thinker I can be.

Being a critical thinker I just plainly see anarchism as the only path that makes reasonable sense for the world. This is just an opinion and is biased and definitely not a statement of Anarchism is the only reasonable position.

The factors that bent my biases towards anarchism is being raised on old movies that had antiauthoritarian sociopolitcal themes such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Grapes of Wrath. A lot of those old shows and movies have the bankers painted as evil. To me this is some of the seeds that were planted in me.

As well my Christian upbringing led me to read literature of Christians in Soviet Russia smuggling bibles around and being persecuted for their faith from a young age. A strange corner we've been covering in this forum, but I believe my Christian upbringing was another set of seeds that gave birth to my anarchist self.

It was around the time that the church was calling for revival and I decided the quickest path to revival was to go onto the streets and preach. Meeting the homeless people and hearing their stories and not just preaching at them led me to see something intrinsically wrong with our society.

I had a girlfriend at one time and honestly her father would come home and a shadow would grow across the room. It wasn't like he was abusive (at least in front of me) of his wife or my girlfriend at the time. It just illustrated to me his hatred of his own existence because of his modern enslavement in a factory. He'd sit and stare into nowhere (he wasn't even looking at the T.V.) He was the model of depression in front of me. He was self loathing and self hatred because he entrapped himself in a system of supporting his family by the means of selling his very soul to his masters.

As my faith in mainstream Christianity fell apart after reading other religious texts than the bible (bhagavad gita/satanic bible) and trying to hang onto some belief in God I became a gnostic centred thinker. Gnostics were against the authority of orthodoxy as well as following the line of Christians who rejected Roman authority a couple millenia ago. It was at this stage of my life I first read Green Anarchy.

I've read the communist manifesto before this point but my critical thinking skills were skeptical and obviously remembering Soviet persecution of Christians and history's tale of this dude they call Stalin as well left me empty of any belonging. Although neomarxism tempted me at certain points I hadn't fully gave into that side of things.

As I was saying Green Anarchy unfortunately or maybe fortunately instantly turned off my critical thinking skills. It appealed to something deep inside me. It appealed to the pains I felt growing up that I couldn't place anywhere (like Neo's splinter in his mind). It appealed to emotions that I didn't know existed in me. It appealed to an unruly lust for justice and freedom in the world. It appealed to so many sides of me that I was just filled with excitement.

I did consider myself a Christian/Gnostic Anarchist at that point but as I said about critical thinking skills - that quickly fell away as I continued reading the journals and not understanding everything.

T.A.Z. by Hakim Bey was given to me like an omen handed down by the gods randomly. That was like a hook inside of my spirit beyond anything I could handle at one point. I read Anarchy: JODA &amp; sought out more and more material.

I fell in with conspiracy theories at this point and the world fell apart for me as well. My shiny view of Christians being the good guys from the west out to save the world from tyrants was shattered. The details of my beliefs at that point may have been wrong however the skeleton of them, that this world is run by evil forces or be it just a world that isn't run but fuelled by greed and running in just fucking circles to bite it's own fucking tail - well that's where I was at.

Fast forward 5 or 7 years or somewhere in between. Still reading a lot of anarchist material. 

Going full circle back to that first green anarchy magazine I found a book in a used book store that was reviewed in that first issue I read. This was found last year. It was EndGame by Derrick Jensen. I ate up half the thing in less than a week. I also was watching The Road a lot during that time. It was an insane bout of cognitive dissonance of thinking that if the world's environment collapsed and we entered anarchy we'd be being chased around by cannibals.

I'm still not really an anarchist at this point. I'm doing work for a publication that is anarchist at this point but still not fully on board. I still pick up the issues like a dog eating up it's dinner. My inner spirit demands more of this material, but my mind can't wrap around some fundamental questions.

It was only this year I've basically raised a black flag in my life. I've realized that my antiauthoritarian views from a young age taught through Christianity and simply the shitty music I listen to and being bullied and ostracized and taught society was the enemy from a young age fit an anarchist point of view.

I realized though society isn't the enemy, it's the whip that drives society to be the way that it is.

The anarchist writings filled philosophical longings inside me. 

It took my spiritual ideas to really formulate why I think Anarchism is a reasonable place to your loyalty towards. Indian philosophies such as Buddhism and Hinduism teach over all that humans are inherently Brahma or Buddhas. I (yeah that fucking religious thinking hasn't left me)

This teaching of the East resonates in me deeply.

I can have faith in humans that they do not need a ruler over them.

The final straw of me becoming an anarchist is that I believe anarchy can work. I believe the negatives of current human relations is reactions to the system around us. Don't get me wrong I believe humans have a bad side to them. I just believe buddhahood will be reached for humans and anarchy will reign.

As well I feel like I want to be on the side of history that actually gave a fuck. The side of history that said "No this is fucking bullshit" in reference to a system ran by greed. The side of history that sought freedom and justice for all. It sought an end to nations wielding their cocks all over the world.

Why am I an anarchist?

Because I am in love with something I've very rarely experienced and that's freedom.

**EDIT**: Here's my story. Read Ayn Rand, got interested in capitalism. Lead me to Marx, became Marxist. Lead me to Bakunin, became anarchist. Lead me to Stirner, became individualist. Combined with Nietzsche and eastern philosophy. Currently reading into fascism. I dislike labels and I don't like most post left writers but it's the closest thing I guess. It doesn't matter much anyway.

Regardless, the opposition is not a progressive force. 

Have your criticisms of the Venezuelan government, but also realize that any sort of victory of the opposition will mean a sprint to the right- less worker control, more privatization, more US influence, more power to business etc etc. 
-----==----==---==-----
The Chavista movement is neither under workers' control itself, and nor is it enacting workers' control in society.

Even where it is nationalising businesses, it is not consistently placing them under seriously democratic workers' control - and without that, nationalisation is just exchanging one set of bosses for another. And it hasn't just opposed workers in specific trade union struggles, but it opposes and undermines trade union democracy and the right and ability of trade unions to stand independent of the state and of the PSUV (and does so wielding the power of the state against workers' organisations!). As far as I have read, the level of democracy inside the PSUV is pretty abysmal too. And it is a party which, in government, cooperates extensively with significant sections of the capitalist class to protect their interests, including at times against the interests of workers, and has been reliant in turn on the support of capitalists. A socialist movement can be imperfect, it can mess up, it can have bad tendencies inside it, but it's really pushing it to suggest, as this movement does, that serving, collaborating with, and relying on the capitalist class is part of some path to socialism. These are basic principles, not dogmatism.

It's perfectly possible to oppose the right, and even defend against the threat of it toppling chavismo, while also opposing chavismo from the left, and saying that if socialism is achievable it has to be founded in the independent power of democratically organised workers.

At multiple points its overall policy has been to oppose and attack workers' struggles - sacking workers who organise, condemning strikers, and supporting repressive measures, even threatening to use the military to intervene in industrial struggles, including against those working for international private sector businesses like Mitsubishi. I certainly don't see how this "revolution" is remotely under the control of workers beyond the level of parliamentary democracy of most capitalist countries.

Really it looks like the chavista regime is just managing capitalism in a substantially more left-wing way than its predecessors. We should oppose right-wing lies and reactionary coups against it, but that doesn't mean the left should be apologists for it.

-----==----==---==-----
yes it is. the only difference is that the governament is weaker now, but the ones trying to bring it down are exactly the same.
  
this isn't a revolution, there won't be changes, freedom and representation of the common folk if the governament falls, that isn't an objective.
  
part of the gdp will go to different hands, and not the hands of the people, not venezuelan people at least.     
that's all.

people are killing and getting killed as cheap proxy soldiers for external powers.   
and once this is over, whatever the result will be, you know what remains? a country with a broken will that spilled their blood and achieved nothing at all.   
will be a new, true, revolution after that? nope, they will feel that resisting and dying for a cause is futile.

as anarchists we cannot and should not support this. this is not what we want, this is oligarchy using the people to fight their wars.

/r/anarchy101 is for questions about anarchism.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;because governments exist, we throw people who form cult of personalities into solitary confinement like Charles Manson.

And what about Stalin? By facilitating who does and does not qualify as having a "cult of personality", the government reaches a level that is characteristic of a cult of personality in and of itself. 

Also, your three examples are probably better arguments against the spectacle than against anarchist self-management.
-----==----==---==-----
Although, to be honest, questions like this can get rather annoying, it's worth answering based simply to on how much it's repeated

"acquire weaponry and power, and use that power to rule over a large body of people"

This is where I think this idea diverts from reality. What makes you think a community that has successfully overthrown state and corporate power would not be able to defend themselves from a small brainwashed cult? We're not hippy pacifists, you know...

The whole basic idea of anarchism is that, since power over others corrupts, we should strive to create a community in which power over others is extremely limited to non-existent. Our current society gives psychopaths every chance to rise to power in government and bushiness. An anarchist society would not provide such opportunities. At most, someone might be able to start a small cult, but an educated community that is taught critical thinking and deconstructing power relations from a young age would be much more resistant to those ideas than the average American today
-----==----==---==-----
Considering how rare these cults are I'm not sure how much of a problem it will be. Besides, I heard a really good explanation for the existence of gangs, cults, etc. For 190,000 years we lived in tightly knit tribes, and with the downfall of tight knit communities with capitalism and the state we seek replacements. Thus more destructive things like cults and gangs begin to prop up to appeal to people's feelings of emptiness. 
-----==----==---==-----
If someone was called upon more often, that person could still refuse, and the others would also be free to make decisions themselves at any time.

What is a possible example of people depressed or suffering enough that it would make them follow someone like this? They would know that history shows many examples of this happening, and I'm not sure how anarchy could result in people feeling this way.
-----==----==---==-----
/r/Anarchy101 will be able to help you out :)
-----==----==---==-----
You answer your own question: Yes, that's exactly why we need to get rid of *both* the state and capitalism.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt; If you get rid of them you would get companies like Apple, and the Koch brothers hiring armies.

This is why anarchists and Marxist-Leninists will often emphasize that "the State" and the ruling economic class cannot be viewed as independent entities. If Apple is raising armies, Apple is the state.
-----==----==---==-----
Not if they're already dead
-----==----==---==-----
Get rid of capitalism first. Replace corporate control with a global network of worker and community cooperatives. Then we can end the state. But we can't talk sensibly about abolishing the state until we have started building something to replace it with.

Isn't it what have already happened, though?
-----==----==---==-----
I think anybody who views pacifism as a practical method for revolution is deluded. The myth that pacifism is the only (or even an effective) way to create change or that violence is a morally or philosophically bankrupt concept is perpetrated by the bourgeois in an attempt to maintain the status quo. Non-violence has it's place but it's not an alternative to violence in many situations. You were totally justified.  
-----==----==---==-----
"I don't even call it violence when it's in self defense; I call it intelligence." -Malcolm X
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;Was I justified?

yes
&gt;“Nobody in history has ever gotten their freedom by appealing to the moral sense of the people who are oppressing them.”
Assata Shakur
-----==----==---==-----
Yes. Violence can end violence also. What should be critiqued and criticised, to avoid this position allowed the violence of anyone, anywhere. Violence should be used in self-defence or in the aim of freedom and liberty, hence why fascists are beaten, because not only does their presence spread a vicious ideology but their ideology is one of action, their free existence anywhere is accompanied from attacks on various groups in society.
-----==----==---==-----
The hippie "violence begets violence" attitude is the result of privilege, inexperience, historical revisionism, and a weirdly condescending view of the agency of oppressed people. 
-----==----==---==-----
I don't even understand their response, especially: "you are hurting yourself, while all we can do is try to stop you." In what way were you hurting yourself? By fighting back? By not fighting back? And in either case, in what way would they "try to stop you"?

Anyway, I don't know if the person you were talking to considers themself a pacifist or what... but their response sounds more like passive victim blaming than anything.
-----==----==---==-----
'People like me watch when you are getting beaten because all we see are sheep running to the slaughter. We aren't hurting you; you are hurting yourself, while all we can do is try to stop you.'

This guy sounds like scum
-----==----==---==-----
Look, if you let someone slam their boot on the back of your neck, its your obligation to rip their god damn legs off. There's no such thing as fighting oppression with pacifism, that's called being delusional. 
-----==----==---==-----
You were entirely justified, and violence can indeed end some forms of oppression. You can never win with the liberal peace police. If you engage in violence, you are asking for whatever response your oppressor desires. If you don't engage in violence, then you're not standing up to oppression. Ignore the trolls, fight back violently when you must and educate when you can.

However, I don't think defensive violence can effectively eliminate the source of oppressive violence. Only education, agitation, and a cultural or social revolution can really do that. But tactically speaking, violence is highly effectively and I think any self-respecting anarchist (or decent human being in general) would not condemn violence in self defense.
-----==----==---==-----
[This book]( http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-how-nonviolence-protects-the-state) totally up-ended my views on pacifism and made me realise that there are times when violent actions need to be undertaken. You may find it an interesting read. It's a pretty quick and straight forward book.
-----==----==---==-----
Considering the popularity of insurrectionism in recent years in America, I think that it's pretty clear that we don't hold a very high view of pacifism as a whole. I am not a "violent person", but I'm not a fucking asshole. I'm skinny and probably would go down in one punch, but I would still defend you.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm largely of the mindset that violence can only free you of the worst aspects of your oppression. Self-defense just fends off the most basic threats to your existence. Eventually, even when the dust settles, there is shit we've internalize that we need to deal with, shit that very clearly oppresses us.
-----==----==---==-----
Imagine you are on an island paradise with one guy who is trying to kill you. By killing him you have brought peace and an end to his oppression.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't think anyone can really answer if you were justified or not, I'm not sure I'd consider *any* form of violence "justified". That's not to say it wasn't necessary or something you should feel ashamed of; your safety was put in danger and you fought to protect yourself.

The reason I shy away from "justified" is attaching any sort of acceptable conditions with violence. In my view, the second you do that the doors are open to change those conditions and eventually you start finding unprovoked violence against others acceptable. It's the thinking that "this person/group doesn't like me so I'd better attack them before they attack me and that's ok because I'm attacking them *before* they have a chance to attack me."

I am in no, way, shape, or form a pacifist and I do recognize there are situations where violence is the only reasonable choice to make in a situation. The person with the greatest power for violence in a given situation (IE: a police officer stopping someone on the street) bears the greatest responsibility for the outcome, be it peaceful or violent, because they posses the greatest power to do violence. If they choose to do violence to the other party they are putting the other party in a position where they may have no options except submission or violent resistance.

Your "left-libertarian" acquaintance sounds, not to put too fine a point on it, like an asshole. It sounds chillingly reminiscent of blaming the victim. Someone who read Ayn Rand and decided to follow it as gospel rather than the literary equivalent of eating wallpaper paste most of her work I've read actually is.
-----==----==---==-----
 You fighting back is self defense, which is needed for survival when people like the ones in you story exist.

As for the people just watching. They have no real obligation to help defend you but I would generally consider them assholes for not doing so.

The left-libertarian seems like a huge coward for victim blaming.
-----==----==---==-----
According to the NAP? Yes.

Also, I'd like to add that the people watching are just disgusting. A complete denial of the universal ethics of 3rd-party self-defense. 
-----==----==---==-----
the coming insurrection was pretty damn influential and definitely has some good parts, but IMO Theory of Bloom was pretentious academic nonsense 
-----==----==---==-----
It's all the rage because communization is the modern form of revolutionary egalitarian struggle (occupy being an example - prefigurative politics). It traces it's origins to the French '68 uprisings where organized labor betrayed students and radicals to settle for "reformed Capitalism". Communization does not emphasize syndicalism or programmism, but instead calls for communism as both the goal and the tactic. Tiqqun and TC are the theoretical backbone of this modern current. Sure, it's esoteric but it deserves recognition. 
-----==----==---==-----
Theory of Bloom is unreadable. I literally have no idea what it is supposed to be about.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm *very* slowly making my way through *Raw Materials for a Theory of the Young Girl*. As a woman, it can be a struggle to get through because of the language and recurring themes which seem specifically feminine, though they explicitly deny that only women can be the "Young Girl." Still, I hesitate to agree with some of the criticism it has received from other women (*especially* that puerile Theory of the Man Child article) that it's wholly misogynistic or that it should be in any way dismissed. There are a lot of very intriguing ideas in there which deserve patience and thought. 

It's also a struggle because of the format of the work, which is very much just a set of "raw materials." There is so much to take in, it really cannot be read like a typical book. Each fragment could easily be expounded on for pages, and there are a lot of gems. 

I have to ask, though. What do you mean that Tiqqun is "all the rage now"? I haven't noticed an increase in interest, but I'm a horrible gauge for that kind of thing. 
-----==----==---==-----
Boring. Some shit everyone should already know expressed in free association and aphorisms, so tangled and lazy it's often just as ineffably wrong as time cube. Its implicit platform is that passion makes a better substitute for intellectual vigilance. So it should be no surprise that its proclamations are occasionally even straighforwardly wrong. The biggest threat to society, its memetic frameworks and institutions are the dispossessed and doomed? Uh, no. ...I almost don't understand how merely the romantic content of such declarations could carry any potency. Do people want it to be true so bad they just fail to quickly check counterfactuals?
-----==----==---==-----
Get theory of the bllom. Seriously, read that shit.

Tiqqun takes all the best things from communization amd synthesizes it with insurrectionary anarchism and UGH SO GOOD.
-----==----==---==-----
I live near several Ukrainians from the eastern part of the country, they seem to be pretty good people. I would never say they are revolting.  :)
-----==----==---==-----
No need to insult them.
-----==----==---==-----
I think that is what will happen next.  East Ukraine will say the government is acting illegally and Russia will volunteer to protect it.  Whether or not the West will jump in at that point I don't know.  I don't think the west will let West Ukraine become land locked.

Russia isn't going to tolerate what is happening now.

&gt;Oppressed peoples are left stranded with little to no resources after researchers leave their communities high and dry.

What researcher (or journalist, even) has ever presented themselves as capable of solving the problems being researched? If they did swoop in and fix everything, then this would be an article about the White Savior complex, or Western meddling. 

&gt;Researchers steal value

"Value" is an immaterial construct with subjective definitions. You can't "steal" it, unless you have some sort of magic powers unbeknownst to science. 

&gt;Articles, books, and dissertations written about marginalized populations are written for academics, not working people

In case this author hasn't noticed, working people aren't craving articles written in their own diction to explain their problems to them. "Oh thank god, an essay written by a foreigner! Everything is gonna be o-kay!"

&gt;real consequences after the researcher leaves

Look, I get that there needs to be more support of the oppressed communities who are studied in these fields. But it's not like all these academics are intentionally trying to keep people oppressed. If you actually look at how capital is distributed in academia, you'll see that the researchers aren't rolling in dough, and the institutions themselves aren't nearly as powerful as this article makes them seem. 

Too many leftists inflate the power of words, probably because they have control of little else. Here in physical reality, the solutions to poverty and oppression require more physical resources and human labor power than academia holds. You can't solve these problems with some clever combination of words. Stating the facts does not change them, and this author exemplifies the Ivory Tower attitude when they assume that oppressed communities are incapable of understanding their own problems without academia's help. In every instance I can recall, academia has always been slow to catch on.

Circlejerk about who is more revolutionary lol

I dont trust self proclaimed revolutionaries so sorry who ever wrote this but u suck.
-----==----==---==-----
This is largely true. As someone who’s a university student and is involved in campus struggle, struggles that often involve or are for academics, many are unwilling to actually be active or partake in direct action. 

That said I don't think most academics are radical at all, most are left-wing liberals at best. The problem of this article is it assumes the problem is one of inaction, in fact the problem is a theoretical one. Most academics are seriously lacking in reasonably analysis, this is partly the cause of the nature of university and how departments are structured. 

That said we shouldn't look to universities for help, the highest levels of class struggle in history came before universities existed, or existed as popular largely public centres - and even the recent struggles of the 1960s the radicalism largely came from students (Situationism et al.) and even this reflected a lack of connection with other group, mainly workers. Capital is slowly, more and more, exerting it's control over universities, restructuring them, but we aren't losing some hotbed of radicalism and activity, rather just a sympathetic populace and an intellectual factory with useful and accurate ideas.

-----==----==---==-----
This is what I posted to that site:

&gt; For this I use the concept of "thoughtaction", which stays "close to the ground". It has a developed conception of "thought", but retains a more everyday sense, as well. It can be take through more rigorous paces (such as the idea of "thought" in Arendt), but also allowed to be less systematic or technical. Yet, it must as well retain what is special and unique to thought as such: the question, not knowing, some anxiety, some beauty, worlds of possibilities. This is coupled or "intersubmitted" with action as such, and is a hybrid condition. This appears to me to be a best form to take to be heedful of some of what this article rightly says is a danger of academicism. Yet "praxis" is too congealed, does not have a free enough sense for thought, and one need spend only a small amount of time around activists to realize just how little free thought can be tolerated, yet to realize as well just now needed it is. It makes one one to turn to the academy, but one finds just as quickly how problematic that is, which the article does get at, as Roy is noted to recognize, etc. 

&gt; Together, this thoughtaction gives new practices (which I call "unfoldings" and the actions it undertakes are variously enconstructive, earchical and envolutionary. Those are jargonish terms, but I think they should be "allowed", provided they are well vetted for their practical viability. The special work of thinking is what I call "unfoldings", akin to consciousness raising, but it has a special character in that it does maintain a more essentially thoughtful form. Yet it is necessary to make passage and to remember nonviolence as well, as neither thought nor action is adequate for this independent, fundamental category. History has shown this very well.
-----==----==---==-----
Well said. Just wanted to remind everyone that /r/access exists and could use some love.
-----==----==---==-----
Yes! I feel this is something the first anarchist thinkers overlooked but Age and Ability are factors of oppression too.
-----==----==---==-----
Also keep in mind that, as anarchists, we need to look past alieving the symptoms of oppression and concern ourselves with undermining it's root causes. 

Starting kickstarters etc to relieve the oppression of a relatively few people is less the objective than advocating the reformation of our institutions so that the systemic suffering of the disabled and elderly is impossible. 

Its not about charity its about liberation imho. This does not mean that you should not volunteer- just that volunteering is not the answer to the big problems...
-----==----==---==-----
I agree, and I'd also like to take this opportunity to point out that many anarchists seem to be lacking knowledge about the radical mental health movement as well.

While Martha Nussbaum is a Rawlsian rather than an anarchist, she does advocate a move toward the Capabilities Approach where society has a moral obligation to assist its constituent members to foster and exercise their capabilities, whatever those may be for the subject in question. She has an interesting section in her book Frontiers of Justice on people with disabilities (and also two sections on citizens of other nations and animals).

They're pushing the socialist aspects of national socialism pretty hard. The old left of the Ukraine is so tightly linked to Russia that it's completely lost all legitimacy and it's letting groups like this steal their thunder.

E.g.: 
- For the trial of Berkut members who killed protesters.   
- Against EU integration on terms that don't benefit the Ukranian people.   
- Against a sham bourgeois democracy.   

This is exactly why Ukrainian leftists should have been at the forefront of the revolution rather than giving radio interviews about how upset they were that right-wing elements were at Maidan - or worse, calling for internal actions that would have split the movement apart. Now the fascists will be able to say they fought and died to overthrow a corrupt "democracy" while the leftist so-called radicals decided to sit it out.
-----==----==---==-----
Sorry - the anarchists in Ukraine lost. The socialists and leftists.

Furthermore, the Praviy Sektor are uncompromising in a good way. Yarosh (the man speaking in this video) today said that not a few members of the opposition are part of the old, corrupt Ukrainian system.

The funny thing is, the Praviy Sektor (or rather - some members of it) have made boogey-men and verbal attacks on leftists and Russians and Jews, but they've been working together alright.

See:

http://www.jta.org/2013/12/08/news-opinion/world/young-jews-take-part-in-ukrainian-protests-along-with-ultranationalists

There was also a thread recently with a badly-translated article, where a local anarchist talked about how leftist groups had a tentative peace with the far-right ones, because they were both fighting the riot police and the repressive security forces. Not saying that they're good and fluffy, but there have been no lynchings of Jews or homosexuals in Kyiv, and only a few beatings of leftists (which most likely came about as an instinctive reaction, no questions asked, rather than after getting to know the people they were beating - much like anarchists like to gang up and beat the shit out of nationalist skinheads, instead of explaining/showing them the error of their ways, which would definitely win more over).

Take that as you will.  I don't support those with hate and fascistic sympathies, but damned if they haven't got shit done while anarchists have... Done what? Twitted and reddited about how it's a fascist coup? Meh. Uninspiring.

Look, I am (and have been and will continue to be) as critical of "anarcho"-capitalists as anyone else here is, but I really don't see the point of this picture. 

What are we supposed to learn from it? That "anarcho"-capitalists like to get together and eat meals with one another? 

What are we supposed to do with this picture? Are we supposed to look at the people in it and laugh at them? Is a picture of them gathered together supposed to be humorous or ridiculous? I certainly hope that nobody will use these pictures to harass the people in it in public. 

Furthermore, out of curiosity, how do we know that these are "anarcho"-capitalists? Before we even try to criticize these people for being "anarcho"-capitalists, we should first and foremost be sure that these people actually are "anarcho"-capitalists and not just random people. Are they part of an "anarcho"-capitalist group that has public meetings?

If you posted a picture of an "anarcho"-capitalist figure (like Murray Rothbard) and pasted a ridiculous pro-capitalist quote they said next to their face, that would have been educative and informative. But this? I'm sorry to say, but I don't see any value to it.

-----==----==---==-----
These revolutions accomplish nothing, just a change of who rules with public awareness intact. As an anarchist I couldn't be more indifferent, the same when my country (Jordan) was swept by revolutions last year.
-----==----==---==-----
Fyi comrades the "revolt" in Nante was not what you think it was. There was a more or less pacific march against the airport and a quite separate bunch of people with no ideologue whatsoever that detach themselves and proceeded to destroy stuff because it's funny.

I want to make this clear because the protest again the airport is legitimate, last for years, and people are great and motivated and this violence goes to the detriment of their ideas. 

There also was quite a lot of police presence and taunting. One may think their was actually foul play to cast a bad image on a group of people that annoyed the government for years (the airport project is one of the now prime minister who was before locally elected)

Our comrades most likely won't just be people with similar interests that band together for this one time, relationships fold, and trust is built - we are human after all. And, if capitalism and the state gets demolished, there will be many who won't will be partying in the street.

It's too early to tell.

The knee jerk reaction to the term fascists is something to watch though. NPR had a good section today "When the wolf cries wolf."

I welcome all dispute and criticism of my views because they are just that: my own views.

However, the basis of *arche*, of hierarchy is the belief in the existence of power and the validity of a monopoly of power through a monopoly of violence. It sets some humans above others either by supposed consent or by the display of force. Some posters may be correct: we may not be ready to accept the horrific cost of billions of people standing up in pacifism, being slaughtered by those who still believe in violent power until the whole world is literally so sickened by the concept itself that they are forced to abandon it.

But anarchism at its most fundamental level, must seek to invalidate the entire concept that force is a valid tool for humans to use against each other. This is why I won't be surprised to see "more of the same" in the Ukraine: the methods have not changed. We're still fighting the power hierarchy in the same way the American Revolutionaries or the French sans-culottes did in the 18th century. I believe it's because we still lack the courage to let the power-hungry self-immolate in an orgy of violence against a new kind of humanity, a humanity that is so sickened by hierarchy and inequality and injustice and violence that they will not even stoop to use these methods in their own defense.

I think the world has changed sufficiently that we no longer need a transitional period between domination and anarchy: it's time for us to put down the tools, quit the jobs, die in horrific numbers under the anger of their guns and give those in power all the rope they need to hang themselves once and for all.

Call me an idealist if you want, but if you do, tell me how my argument is flawed. Tell me how you can be an anarchist and still be comfortable wielding the tools of the oppressors, not believing that it will change your heart.

It's great that they're doing something, terrible that they can't put nonviolence together. There seems little doubt to me that were this accomplished through a really massive national strike, without violence (aside from the violence inherent in striking), the overall outcome would be far better, along with the side effects. The lives lost do remain very important, for one thing. But it sets the stage for what is to come, and one way or another it involves a deep affirmation of violent force, which in most matters is pretty illusory, since compliance bought by a gun is simply not the same as compliance or even enlistment through a more original will that is not coerced. 
-----==----==---==-----
Are these anarchists? Sorry I haven't been paying attention to the Ukraine's situation recently, I, incorrectly, assumed it was uneventful.

The Internet is causing a lot of these struggles, worldwide. It's the Internet. Clickable reality opens minds and minds once opened don't want to close. True, various factions, multiple interests from conservative to liberal to radical to who knows what are at play in most all of these, but the clickabiltiy of the Internet is playing a very big role in the readiness for people to revolt. Are there more revolts per square inch of the Earth these days? I don't know.

-----==----==---==-----
The article is pretty shoddy stuff, apparently actually aimed at the kind of interpretative *relativism* or *nihilism* that we did indeed see among people who skimmed over the top of the vast and varied body of work that was called "postmodernist." But to claim that this is the "real politics," when there's not a single concrete reference to anything, seems obviously inadequate. In fact, it seems "postmodern" in precisely the bad sense being attacked here.

That's a hell of a lot of ink for something you're going to want to be mass producing.

The part where it says Anarchism is not: blah blah blah all three words should be the same part of speech. Right now you have chaos and terrorism which are nouns and violent which is an adjective. It makes it read funny. Change violent to violence.
-----==----==---==-----
I would drastically simplify the message, which would also help with all the ink being used as /u/SewenNewes mentioned. 

Additionally, there are things on the pamphlet which I think are not helpful to say (and most importantly are not true). For example, the phrase

&gt; Anarchist theory is really rather complicated

I don't think this is true at all. It's actually quite simple. People shouldn't have power over others unless there is a really good reason for it. That's amazingly simple. Sure, there may be many different ideas and "theories" (if you want to elevate it to that term) but those are just different implementation ideas, which for the most part are themselves largely unsupported by much rational basis (I prefer a more experimental approach with loose theoretical outlines). 

You might also consider easing them into the ideas more and not going hard-core anarchist on them in this pamphlet. For example, the phrase 

&gt; This means that they wish to create a stateless, moneyless society in which everybody is free. 

Now, this is more or less true (with some variability in whether all anarchists would get rid of any sort of currency), but it might be a bit hard for someone to digest this as a practical approach to today's reality. This isn't because it's impossible, but it's hard to imagine our society transforming to a moneyless society overnight (which is what most readers will likely incorrectly think about when they read this). They will likely not think about it as a gradual transformation or a transformation which would occur in a society where the dominant ideology was not a capitalist one. 

So I think, if you wanted to really be effective, you should concentrate not on the hard-core principles of anarchism per se, but rather the trends (in other words, how anarchism wants to transform society) -- it wants *more* liberty for the people, *more* control in their workplace, *better* living conditions, *less* war, a *greater* concern for the environment and the future, etc. This is far from anyone's imagination, and if they are interested in these ideas they'll later see it less controversial to pursue these above ideals to their ultimate ends (the stateless, moneyless society in other words). 

Edit: Forgot to add, thanks for your work.

&gt; Anarchism doesn't want to destroy industry, but to make it fair, sustainable and fun. People want to work, but they can't do the things they want because there is rent and tax to pay...

I don't really agree with any of these statements. I am an anarcha-primitivist and I actually do believe that industry should be destroyed and I do not believe that "people want to work." Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the idea that industry can be fair and sustainable sounds like an anarcho-syndicalist belief, which of course is part of anarchism but doesn't represent anarchists as a whole. The idea that "people want to work" also sounds communist to me. I have met a lot of anarchists who reject the idea of work. If you mean "work" in the sense of self-improvement, then maybe I agree with you, but it sounds like you're claiming that all people want to have some sort of job, which is just not true at all. Does anyone else agree with me that some of this doesn't sound like anarchism at all, or am I misinformed?

Hi giga,

I really like this new 'inside,outside' version! I don't have too many comments, as I think it's very good on the whole. The one comment I have is that I think you could end it better. The last sentence you have

&gt; If some people are compelled to do the worst chores to get money, it's not fair on them, and there's no reason why they should be forced to

is a sentence I wouldn't end with. For one, I don't think it reads particularly well. Secondly, it's got a lot of ideas embedded in it (particularly the idea that labor is not really voluntary when you are forced to sell yours) and it might confuse the reader just as they finish the pamphlet. 

So yeah, I'd take it out and substitute something else that would still be consistent with what you are saying in that paragraph. You could say something instead about how technology should be used to free man from the labor that no one wants to do such that man has the option of doing labor that he finds meaning in, or something like that. The benefit of such a statement is that not only does it instill some promise and hope for an anarchist vision of society, but it might also instill some sort of anger at the current system for holding back the kind of lives we could be living.

There are probably other things you could say here too of course, just one idea. 


-----==----==---==-----
I may be a bit too late to this conversation, but I'll say it anyway: holy wall of text Batman.
One of the most important lessons I was taught when I went to Journalism school is that you have between 5-7 seconds before a person decides if they want to commit and read your article. If it looks too "wordy" and/or there's nothing to break up the text, people won't read it. People have short attention spans, they won't tolerate a wall of text kind of approach.

The front of your pamphlet, with the symbols is good because the pictures break up the text. Perhaps on the back there could be a chart or a diagram of some kind. This would also be helpful to people who learn better by viewing pictures instead of just words.

The more "meaty" parts of what Anarchism is and is not should be left for the web-for those people who have committed themselves to spending a bit of time reading an essay or 5.

He claims OWS was just a bunch of "drum circles". Does he not realize this is the same thing people said about the anti-war protests in the 1960s? Indeed, this is a common tactic to vilify activists who take control of public space to raise awareness. Just call them hippies and drum circles. Attack them. Ignore their message.

What do you know? This guy is a [libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Stanhope). No wonder why he is against OWS. He doesn't care about inequality. What is this bullshit doing in /r/anarchism, and why is it being upvoted?


-----==----==---==-----
Really what his argument boils down to is "if they had just done everything in the exact manner I'm describing, it would have all worked out and everyone would have supported them". Obviously there's absolutely no way to know if any of that is true and does not acknowledge the external forces working against ows. Secondly its just plain ignorant and obviously shows he knows nothing about movement building.

I kinda agree, but feel this is almost reductionistic. Of *course* we are literally all just atoms, from dust to dust. But that ignores higher level concepts that get introduced when we have to deal with humanity. Sure, someone spending ages working and developing land is just a bunch of atoms moving around - but if we're going to ignore a person's effort then why bother with ideology at all?
-----==----==---==-----
I agree that this mentality is fucking awful, but I question how unique it is to Western civilization (as in, the Arabs, Chinese, Indians, etc. also didn't hold a similar mentality or have similar property relations, considering how their civilizations had extremely rigid class relations, patriarchy, and such).
-----==----==---==-----
 “The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said "This is mine," and found people naïve enough to believe him, that man was the true founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows: Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.”

― Jean-Jacques Rousseau a "western" philosopher
-----==----==---==-----
Um, I'm not sure how accurate this essay is. 

&gt;The Venezuelan government actually controls all of the TV stations, and has threatened with sanctions radio stations and newspapers that transmit information about protests.

This doesn't seem to be true.  According to the BBC, [70% of all radio and television stations are privately owned](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19368807).  Although I don't doubt that the government is trying to repress reporting on the current protests. 

I think its also important to note that folks at the spearhead of the right-wing components of the protesters were deeply involved in the 2002 coup attempt (i.e. Leopoldo Lopez).  I'd like to see a popular uprising against the Venezuelan government, and a subsequent decentralization of political and economic power, but people are seriously delusional if they think the business elites currently at the center of these protests are going to pursue this route.  

Nonetheless, I think the position this essay takes is decent.  Help the victims of state violence, point out popular discontent with the current regime, but don't try to actively help the right-wing opposition.  
-----==----==---==-----
The situation in Venezuela, as in states with other uprisings, is incredibly complex, with many actors with many different goals, visions, and behaviors. However, as anarchists, we cannot bend over backwards to defend a state, not matter how "leftist", that is killing people in the streets, that makes students "disappear" and return home a week later with the scars of torture and sexual assault. 

Yes, there are elements of the protestors that are right-wing and nationalist. But to reduce the the fact that people are going to the streets to fight for their lives to simple narratives of an Imperialist conspiracy or to a unified front of morally innocent protestors is a mistake. And it seems that the left has a poverty of analysis for these complex situations, especially the institutional left, which is spitting back word for word the claims of the Venezuelan government. Really? Because the president wears red he is immune to accountability for torture, corruption, and dealing in death? As anarchists, we need to do better. 

As the events of Ukraine, Venezuela, and Bosina have shown, anarchists are on the sidelines, mere spectators. Why? When we suppose that we have so much to offer? It is because we have nothing to offer. We need to start to develop languages, analysis, strategies, and praxis to navigate complex uprisings, to speak to them, and to engage with and support the people when they rise against the state. We can not fall into traps of simplification, dogma, and ideological blindness. If we do so, the cost is human lives, and the very possibility of our projects.

A friend of mine is a Venezuelan refugee. Certainly middle-class, before the government made currency exchange less of an uncertainty, he could pay to attend university. However, his experiences, the experiences of his family, and his analysis cannot be ignored. He has stated that 
&gt;I also think that referring to the opposition as "the right" is extreme and uninformed. I'm by no means a right-wing person, and many people in the opposition aren't. We are progressives, radical left-wingers, nationalists, anarchists, conservatives, etc. This is no longer a left-right discussion, this is a government vs. the people issue"

The problem for anarchists becomes, how can we support uprisings against violent governments, while building adequate understandings of the complexity of actors that make up "the people", without dismissing that many are in the streets fighting for their lives. Further, how can anarchists build practices that increase the viability of anarchist projects, analysis, and praxis within such uprisings? How do we stop being mere spectators and speculators? What can we offer?

Shit. Man, this has me thinking about reverse racism. There is reverse *racial prejudice* but no way in hell is there a reverse *racism*, where blacks have subjected whites to imperialism and hegemony over political, economic, and social power.
-----==----==---==-----
Some humans did some bad shit. Why the need to refer to them as "white people"? If I pointed out that most criminals were black, I'd get slammed for pointing out irrelevancies and for implying the fallacy of correlation being causation. Rightfully so, but you can get away with the same bullshit against "white people"?

I don't believe in reverse racism. I don't care for being made fun of for being white. I have no personal stake in this. I just want people to be fucking consistent. If I shouldn't tie things to someone being "black", then I shouldn't tie things to someone being "white". The justification here is racist and fallacious.

"We can get away with this because the people who did bad happened to have been white." Getting over racism is not "accepting that black people and others were exploited by white people" That still sees race. That still sees color. Getting over racism is not judging *anyone* and *anything* (history in this case) by race.
-----==----==---==-----
The state takes under its banner pretty much every concern, even when   it causes the problem in the first place. It claims to be the source of all stability, ecology and health, but this needs to be understood as doublespeak. In reality, the state makes capital's ecological destruction a stable standard.

Anarchists should work to make the narrative of the human-nature relationship more representative of reality: Ecology and therefore human health bring complete ILlegitimacy to the state and lifestyles of the rich. A lifestyle of the rich is derived directly from exploiting not only workers but by destroying nature and future life. The bourgeois dominion is not limited to the human species. 

Liberal environmentalists are a danger, not because they care about ecosystems and health, but because they make a theoretical error by trusting the enemy with ecology. This error could definitely result in fascism, but correcting it will turn them against the state.  

The enemy is not ecology and health, but is rather the doublespeak-appropriation of legitimate causes by the state. expose these simple contradictions because that's the only way we're going to get help with our movement. 
-----==----==---==-----
Anything to distract from ethics and morality.
-----==----==---==-----
This is dumb.

Unless you have a plan to get rid of the state in the next, say, five years, it is utterly imperative that its power somehow be directed towards ecological preservation. Global warming is not a fucking joke.

The world is seeing a backlash from reactionary elements in society. Thailand Venezuela, Ukraine. I enjoy seeing nuance in this article but I despise the whole false equivalence between the media coverage. 
The accusation of censorship will have to wait for more evidence. I find it hard that the Venezuelan government randomly blocked twitter for a few hours only to lift it. Isn't just as likely the ISP which is responsible for most of the country got overloaded? Wouldn't this be the same for the reported slowdowns?

Just think it out for a minute. Its not like protest aren't being covered. They are all over the news. I keep hearing that the tv news in the country isn't reporting them but I have no way to even confirm that. The opposition has a reputation for hyperbole. And not to mention that a majority of people have voted for Maduro and his party. My impression of this whole fiasco was that the opposition hijacked these protests and implemented a long standing plan to pull off a hard or soft coup.

But I want to make an observation and ask a question. It seems when ever there is protest or something radical is done people on the left, and anarchists are particularly guilty of this, just throw their support weight behind the protesters no matter what. You can see this in the protests of the past few months and with DGR. A little over year ago DGR was cock of the walk. They were getting praise for being so radical, whatever that means. If you took a minute to look at any of their actions. They were mostly grandstanding protests that affected little or no change at all.  IT stands to reason that if anarchism is going to be taken seriously is going to focus on collective action aimed at improving the lives of working people and not just making some radical statement that means nothing to a majority of people.

The question i want to ask is what is a state and a population  supposed to do when there has been a history of coups that usher in a very despotic government (in the case of South America A fascist one). Suddenly all the same variable line up again in an all too familiar way. Supposed that  my theory is correct and the opposition tired to pull of a soft coup ( think egypt and the military and morsi) Isn't it appropriate to put the coup down and stop those circumstances? I think a false conception that every state is a powerful as the United States. Venezuela is not even close. It doesn't preclude them from criticism and yes eventually state should be done away with. But until then what is to be done?

-----==----==---==-----

[This](http://www.timothyeastman.com/uncategorized/an-interview-with-mira-andrei-and-sascha-of-antifascist-action-ukraine/) is an interview with some anti-fascist people who've participated in the Euromaidan protests. 
-----==----==---==-----
It brings up an interesting question. If you are an anarchists, would you participate in an uprising that is heavily dominated by fascist radicals? I say no, because all the protestors are looking to accomplish is to replace the current regime with their own. If anarchists did participate the outcome could be similar do what happened during the Russian Revolution, when Bolsheviks killed anarchists, and in Spain when the Communist party massacred the CNT anarchists.
-----==----==---==-----
couple of excerpts: 

&gt;AMY GOODMAN: Your response to [Obama's] response . 

&gt;STEPHEN COHEN: To what he just said? Shame. Shame. He is saying that the responsibility for restoring peace is on the Ukrainian government, and it should withdraw its security forces from the streets. 

&gt;**But let me ask you, if in Washington people throwing Molotov cocktails are marching on Congress—and these people are headed for the Ukrainian Congress—if these people have barricaded entrance to the White House and are throwing rocks at the White House security guard, would President Obama withdraw his security forces? This is—this is—and do you know what this does? And let’s escape partisanship here. I mean, lives are at stake. This incites, these kinds of statements that Obama made. It rationalizes what the killers in the streets are doing. It gives them Western license, because he’s not saying to the people in the streets, "Stop this, stop shooting policemen, stop attacking government buildings, sit down and talk."** 

&gt;And the guy you had on just before, a so-called moderate leader, what did he just tell you? "We have lost control of the situation." That’s what I just told you. He just confirmed that. 

&gt;So what Obama needs to say is, "We deplore what the people in the streets are doing when they attack the police, the law enforcement official. And we also don’t like the people who are writing on buildings 'Jews live here,'" because these forces, these quasi-fascist forces—let’s address this issue, because the last time I was on your broadcast, you found some guy somewhere who said there was none of this there. All right. What percent are the quasi-fascists of the opposition? Let’s say they’re 5 percent. 

&gt;I think they’re more, but let’s give them the break, 5 percent. But we know from history that when the moderates lose control of the situation, they don’t know what to do. The country descends in chaos. Five percent of a population that’s tough, resolute, ruthless, armed, well funded, and knows what it wants, can make history. We’ve seen it through Europe. We’ve seen it through Asia. This is reality. And where Washington and Brussels are on this issue, they won’t step up and take the responsibility. 


&gt;She said, "F— the European Union," and everybody said, "Oh, my god! She said the word." The other thing was, who leaked it? "Oh, it was the Russians. Those dirty Russians leaked this conversation." But the significance is what you just played. What are they doing? 

&gt;**The highest-ranking State Department official, who presumably represents the Obama administration, and the American ambassador in Kiev are, to put it in blunt terms, plotting a coup d’état against the elected president of Ukraine.**

&gt;Now, that said, Amy, Juan, you may say to me—neither of you would, but hypothetically—"That’s a good thing. We don’t like—we don’t care if he was elected democratically. He’s a rat. He’s corrupt." And he is all those things. He is. "Let’s depose him. That’s what the United States should do. 

&gt;**Then the United States should stand up and say, ’That’s what we do: We get rid of bad guys. We assassinate them, and we overthrow them.’" But in Washington and in Brussels, they lie: They’re talking about democracy now. They’re not talking about democracy now; they’re talking about a coup now.**

No, you do those things in hopes of being rewarded. That's human nature. Of course, you can settle with not being rewarded, too, because it acts as an investment. There's more reward than just monetary compensation too. You also do good out of fear/punishment. "Bad guys" are outcasts. You don't want to be an outcast, but if you could, you *would*.

If there were no rewards or punishments, you wouldn't do it. Why can't we accept that being good has a rational explanation? "Good" is not some metaphysical force. We can explain it. Both parties benefit and try to get something out of the relationship. If you think you're "just doing good for its own sake", that you aren't trying to gain even a bread crumb's worth of feedback, then you're delusional.

I added a trigger warning for domestic violence to your post since when I read it I did not expect it to start out with jokes about domestic violence to show how they're not funny.
-----==----==---==-----
Thankfully the kind of scientific study that is the crux of this article is something that privileged, "unintentional" bigots might actually listen to.
-----==----==---==-----
Can somebody explain to me how trying to censor what other people are saying isn't a breach of the basic human right, freedom of speech? Not saying I disagree with the post, I legitimately can't see how you can have both.
-----==----==---==-----
To those who find the jokes described in the article funny: I humbly suggest that you put yourself into a rape/domestic violence survivor's shoes, and see if you still laugh. If so, then OK, it may be that it's actually funny. (Although it may also be that you're having trouble being empathic.)

EDIT: wording of last sentence sounded a bit too patronizing.
-----==----==---==-----
Some jokes can be bad, but using those jokes to say that all jokes that touch on different facets of life are automatically unacceptable the person who does this is being hostile is worse.

People who think like this are hostile (and sanctimonious).

Take an insult comedian like Don Rickles for example, he's trying to be funny by breaking all of the rules, he not there to hurt people.  Humor should be able to go past any taboo.

You may not call those kind of jokes funny, but I do. Are you saying that because I find a JOKE funny, that I'm a sexist/racist/homophobic? Also, the last bit there is the icing on the cake. I love how she just sweeps rape, domestic abuse, and sexual abuse against men under the fucking rug. How about instead of attacking me because I find a JOKE funny, don't fucking listen to them! And if you happen to hear someone say them, ask them to please not, instead of calling them a sexist/racist/homophobic.
-----==----==---==-----
i truly believe that these kinds of jokes are important.

Simply because you don't talk about difficult subjects like this normally. Not only homophobia, but rape, sexism homelessness, and the similar bad stuff. Not because it is funny, although it may be, but if you get offended, it is probably because you have a strong opinion about it. And that being an opinion you need to get out. Ether because you actually have experienced it, or know someone who has. And that leading then to the subject actually being talked about.

And although it is bad, that it has to be done that way, there are not that many ways the talks will pop up at other times. Simply just sitting down with your friends and say "lets talk about sexism" is not gonna get long. But a joke, brings it to the thoughts, that reminds you to think about it.

Just joking about it and talking about rape, i myself have basically changed my reasons behind it a lot. Simply because you put your thoughts out, to be confirmed, or disproven. 

In your own head, you can justify a lot of stuff that doesn't hold up in real life.

Just needed to get that out.....

I hope everyone in this community realizes that total unity can only be achieved if we drop all forms of identity politics, even feminism is causing a great deal of devision and distraction. That's a hard pill for people to swallow but all you need to do is read edward bernays for proof (nephew of sigmund freud, creator of the CFR and the worlds first PR firm), feminism has been used for political and monetary gain since the 60's.

The status quo absolutely uses race baiting and sex baiting to their advantage and we've universally fallen for these tactics since the 1960's.

I wan't unity and equality for all and i don't think we need to adhere to any political affiliation or social paradigm to achieve this.

I am from Turkey and I see a very troubling situation here. I understand the fact that the opposition is right wing and it also bothers me to see Leopoldo Lopez gaining power from this situation. But George Ciccariello's commentary is unbelievably similar to what was the conservative right-wing media was saying in Turkey during the Gezi Protests. 
I know that this two cases are different from each other, but still... All of this situation in Venezuela can well be manipulated by US and they can use this to make Venezuela another puppet government, but to call a protest (people on the streets) a coup doesn't really sound much different than what Erdogan was saying against the protestors in Turkey. So it gives you to right to deploy police with water cannons and tear gas.

I think this video may of been made by antideutsch, I'm not connected with them, I'm interested in what the cop is saying, he seems quite reasonable, he could of been a nice guy...

The translation could have been better. 

He said "Nation" (meaning the people) which was translated to "State" (meaning the government).

He said "Normaly Lude" (meaning Good people), which was translated to Normal People.


I feed really bad for most of the conscripts in the police that are put on the front line. They do not really have a choice. (And the choice of going to jail for disobeying an order is not really a choice).

What the protesters are doing is helping the government, as they are giving them reason for banning future protests and civil actions. The eastern part of the country is now starting to support the current government (after they were loosing support there), this is just sad.

 


-----==----==---==-----
Excellent OP, and excellent discussion thus far. This is something that I, too, have pondered at length.

I think it's really quite simple, and mostly a matter of psychology. The fact that the world is a corrupt, wealth/power-siphoning machine in which we are violently abused and rendered powerless is **extremely** terrifying, and potentially traumatizing. Fear and powerlessness of such a scale is a very difficult thing for anyone to cope with, and our minds have numerous ways of dealing with it - most of them irrational, but very useful for our mental health.

Most people are simply stuck in the very initial phase of resistance to this terrible truth: denial - every human brain's go-to "first line" of defense (and rightly so; it's very good at its job). Those who have found their own denial to be insufficiently believable or pacifying, or who have broken through it in other ways, move to another psychic self-defense against what is essentially profound and unparalleled fear: false empowerment.

In our case, this false empowerment first re-asserts some agency or dominance: the terrified person is eager to feel that they have "figured it out," and indeed, our brains love nothing more than collecting and connecting information into patterns, even when those patterns aren't real. The grand conspiracy theory allows a terrified, disempowered person to feel like they have a "leg up" on the conspirators, while injecting their self-esteem with an incredibly vital boost. That the conspiracy theory is unpopular, a "secret," subject to misinformation by powerful entities, etc., serves well to make their privileged knowing all the more valuable, and make the theorist "victorious" against even greater odds. This is an unfortunate but very forgiveable position for a human to assume. In the absence of the right historical and/or class analysis, it's probably one of the only safe havens for such a mind to arrive at.

Unfortunately, because of its nature as a desperate (and incredibly important) psychic self-defense measure against utter despair and perceived impotence, this thoerizing must be cemented and shored up copiously, and the investment that people put into it very quickly grows immense. The conspiracy theory becomes the one thing that allows the person to retain some understanding or agency - and if not actual agency, then at least egoist superiority of some kind, compared to the "sheeple." Again, really quite forgiveable considering the circumstances - I would not declare myself or anyone I know to be immune from these incredibly powerful defenses within our minds (and I would further say that I'm grateful that they're there).

So what's missing, here? And where can such a mind go from that point of desperate, clinging defense of the ego? (note: "ego" has quite a tarnished reputation, these days, and I must clarify that I mean it in truly the broadest sense - one's sense of self as safe, good and empowered, mostly.)

Well, for one thing, we can provide an alternative source of understanding and agency. Replace the grand conspiracy with the simple truth about the [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) results of hierarchical society and economy - what I've heard described as "the un-spiracy." Replace the deployment of ["cloud busters"](http://www.orgonite.info/how-to-make-chembusters.html) and Zeitgeist screenings (okay, maybe the latter aren't the *worst* idea) with on-the-ground organizing, community and workplace projects, direct action etc. Really, with the typically more social component, these sources of agency are much more effective at supporting mental health, anyway.

The problem is, again, that conspiracy theories placate some of the most very basic, **primal** parts of our mind, and this form of defense must, by its very nature, be **extremely** resilient. Breaking through it might be comparable to how some mental health professionals struggle to tear down the similarly self-defensive conceptions of some of their patients (whether those conceptions are worthy of such destruction or not) - sometimes for decades without success. As to how to go about doing that, I have no specific tips, just general guesswork:

* Education is almost never a bad thing, and may provide the framework for a more rational, class/race/gender/etc-based socioeconomic analysis. The emergence principles that I linked above can also be a useful tool for showing how some very intricate and "inexplicable" patterns can emerge from a field with just a few very simple rules, just like water molecules arranging themselves into snowflakes.

* Welcome and social acceptance might be the most important thing of all. Social drives are perhaps the most powerful that our minds possess, and giving someone the opportunity to join and participate in a community that truly cares about them can overcome almost any other situation which does not offer those things. Our modern anarcho-habits of talking shit on everyone, machismo et al are not doing us favors, here, but I wouldn't claim to know their value or motives to those engaging in them (and I do it, too - though I try not to).

* Participatory, empowering action could be just as vital. There are so few footholds to gain a sense of real agency and empowerment in this overwhelming shithole of a societal "order" that a well-executed direct action, or even a simple radical newspaper, can be an absolute game-changer in terms of how a person copes with the awfulness. I think it's this action-based empowerment, as well as the social supports as just mentioned, that have allowed the Occupy movement (and really, most movements) to have a remarkable legacy of people still dedicated to activism when they had never considered it before getting involved.

* Let's **support** each other! Our dominant culture is one of subtle social dominance games and individual isolation, and in many of our little circle-a scenes we haven't gotten as far from that as we might like. People turn to conspiracy theories, in my analysis, because they have real, legitimate needs in order to sustain their mental well-being. We all have such needs! Let's embrace those needs, and each other, and form communities that are honest, caring, welcoming even to those who believe differently, and understand that we don't just "want" the people we know to support us - but **need** them to!

TL;DR: To "convert" a conspiracy theorist, offer them an analysis that doesn't need a conspiracy, stroke their ego, give them an outlet to be empowered, and offer social welcome and support.

Yes your post makes sense. Why here in anarchism tho? I think you premise is sound, but I don't think many conspiracy theorists believe the illuminati thing. 

Well didn't they just complete a university study proving a very small number of people own pretty much everything? I'm going to try to find it, give me a few. 

Here it is: http://www.plosone.org/articleinfo%3Adoi%u2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0025995#s3

-----==----==---==-----
Sure, your post is coherent.  

Simply, I think you can come to a much easier and direct conclusion.  I agree with pretty much everything you wrote other than the last bit.  And even so, class antagonism for the conspiracy theorist is huge only in that it is the main stumbling block.

So anyhow, I would say that those who rely on conspiracy to explain what they *know* is wrong do so from a position of privilege.  By adopting the mantra that "we just need to expose them," them being a secret cabal that is small in number and defeat-able through education, they effectively discount all struggle.  The conspiracy theorist is looking for the easy answer that provides them very little real hardship.  It's just like religion really.  

It might be important to note that some of them are using conspiracy stuff *exactly* like religion.  Those folks just aren't going to be coming over the sane side anytime soon.  I know a girl whose parents died in a very tragic way, she strangely turned to conspiracy theories to help her explain the world. So yeah...
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;I believe this is because they have a body of information that is very wide but shallow (rather than deep).

 This is wrong. A lot of 'conspiracy theorists' will have very narrow and detailed knowledge of things, such as historical events.

 &gt;

    For example a conspiracy theorist is generally opposed to American foreign policy

    understands that our wars are more about making the rich richer rather than national defense

    Conspiracy theorists are generally opposed to the police forces, politicians, and super-corporations

    Conspiracy theorists tend to be more radical and tend to deviate from the standard narrative.

Very true, and this is why 'conspiracy theorists' are not a joke. These people could be socialists/anarchists with a coherent grasp of society and become effective agitators. Instead, they are disrupted.
***
 I think you make a good point that they lack the general framework to systematise their knowledge and make further insights. 

 A lot of it is a dramatisation of reality; it introduces arcane and magical motivations where mundane ones would do (illuminati, free masons, bloodlines, etc, vs. greed, megalomania, ignorance, etc.). It involves a suspension of disbelief, where any hypothesis will do as long as it is 1) sensational, and 2) shows the ruling elite to be evil and conniving. 

 It functions as a kind of religion, with prophets whose word is accepting unquestioningly, satisfaction is found by selective application of scepticism. It also functions as a form of entertainment. It turns the real world into a thriller movie, where the participant is granted unique insight into the system. This partly accounts for why the 'conspiracy theorist' worldview is so sensational.

 Furthermore, 'conspiracy theorists' rarely have a coherent solution. Sure, maybe the people have to rise up, but rise up and do what? Very often the focus is on the individual, with little attention paid to mass action.
***
 However, just because 'conspiracy theorists' can have such wacky, superstitious views doesn't mean that nothing is a conspiracy - a conspiracy merely being a plan made by more than one person. This is an equally stupid idea. Most people tend toward this view, and are extremely naive and ahistoric in their incredulity that people in positions of power would have malicious intent.

 &gt;Conspiracy theorists tend to believe that a small group of fat cats sit stroking their mustaches hatching plans for world economic domination.

Undoubtedly there are figures who look at the globe as a chess board and scheme like super villains. The point is not to obsess over this esoteric, sensational aspect, but to break society into a machine best explained by concepts such as class, hierarchy, and psychology (e.g. cognitive dissonance).

***

**Tl;Dr** Good point. 'Conspiracy theorists' are potential radicals, but they are disrupted by their sensational and superstitious worldview. We should be concerned with this. *A brief description of some aspects of the 'conspiracy theorist' outlook.* However, conspiracies do happen (but they're not done by lizards).

I actually become an Anarchist by going through the conspiracy theory route. Now, I've researched things from the more concrete to absolute idiocy every way I could. What I've learned is that people have a tendency to latch onto information as if it's the only thing keeping them afloat. Whether right or wrong, information is information unless you've experienced said information yourself. I don't know you all feel about this, but for 9/11 there is evidence to show that at the very least the State let the attack happen. At most there is evidence that the State perpetrated the attack. You can create patterns out nothing but when the pattern creates itself then maybe it's worth looking at. The elite of this world have no problem killing millions and destroying countries. Do you think they really care about a few thousand people and a couple of buildings? Qui bono?

I guess I really didn't answer OPs questions too much. I think the reason why conspiracy theorists are incoherent in arguing is that they tend to believe they have all the answers when they really don't. So when you call them out on it they go ballistic. In my opinion, a decent conspiracy theorist is willing to admit when they're wrong, yet not dump the theory out of hand. They also cross references as much information as possible to get a clearer picture of the conspiracy. Since they don't get caught up in fear porn they tend to be drowned out by those who do.

Here are the stages that I think most conspiracy theorists go through:
1. Denial of the theory.
2. Research of the theory.
3. Acceptance of the theory.
4. Proselytizing of the theory.
5. Social ostracizing of the theorist.
6. Depression of the theorist.
7. Mental restructuring of the theorist.
8. Mellowing of the theorist.

Life still goes on whether 9/11 was an inside job or not.
-----==----==---==-----
I think many conspiracy theorists can be called closet authoritarians if they seem to project the image that everything would be better if they were in charge (it wouldn't, their simplistic views devolve everything into black and white morally and they will end up a shade of grey no one recognizes). 

Some conspiracy theorists may be unaware of class however we know some conspiracy theorists can have leftists beliefs concerning things getting better if people start to share. They may only be leftists because they believe sharing is caring, not that there are explicit divides in the classes themselves that need more than slogans to overcome.

Honestly by talking about "THEM" we may in fact be attracting attention. I got here from /r/conspiratard and oh my we may have to expect company.

The range of people that can fall under the umbrella "conspiracy theorists"  is exceedingly broad; labeling all of them as "incoherent" is therefore fallacious.  Pick the craziest among them, and paint all with the same broad brush.  That particular tactic is transparent, unconvincing, counterproductive, and convinces no one save those who have already made up their mind.  
-----==----==---==-----
This is the dumbest fucking bullshit I've ever read. You're talking about "conspiracy theorists" is a completely abstract way that is separated from any real examples. There's a big difference between numb nuts saying that reptilians control the world and people questioning the validity of the 911 commission report.

This shit is not coherent because it takes place in the abstract. You are not citing a "conspiracy theory" and explaining why it's untrue. You are just making sweeping generalizations about a straw man you've constructed.
-----==----==---==-----
Why are Anarchists so harsh on "conspiracy theorists"? It can't be the stigma attached to them by the mainstream, because Anarchists have that too- perhaps moreso. They are natural allies. They don't all have an anarchist ideology perhaps, but they hold the same principles in their hearts.

Also, anarchists would and have been, assuming such CTs are in some cases true, the primary target of the powers upstairs. Think of Hedges' analysis and critique of the Radical American Movements and their stymieing, or about how the three spheres of power in the Western World (Democratic/Republican forces, Communists and Fascists), who were supposed to be absolutely opposed, all collaborated in the crushing of the Barcelona revolution.

Where these not clearly "conspiracies" against a better humanity?
-----==----==---==-----
Making generalizations about conspiracy theorists tends to excacerbate intellectual segregation rather than unification. 

Most conspiracy theorists realize these days are people with computers. Hell, I'd go so far as to say most peope are conspiracy theorists whether they admit it or not. The MSM has gone a long way towards dismissing the notion that groups of people might collaborate in secret towards their common goals, and what's more, the MSM has demonized people who maintain this notion and lunatics and madmen.

I don't think we need, or even can have, an abstract hypothesis to explain all conspiracy theories. I do think that power disparity lends itself to secrecy, though. The people on bottom don't tell the people on top the unpleasant truths because the latter have the ability to make the truths of the former even less pleasant. The people on top don't trust the people on bottom in turn and we end up with a laundry list of secrets.

Anarchists are by definition conspiracy theorists.
-----==----==---==-----
I suggest you read Richard Hofstadter's classic "The Paranoid Style in American Politics," wherein he examines how conspiracy agit-prop (usually by the far-right) is used to manipulate the popular discourse. 

http://studyplace.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/files/courses/reserve/Hofstadter-1996-Paranoid-Style-American-Politics-1-to-40.pdf

Also, about a decade ago The 5th Estate (an anarchist publication based in Detroit) published this article “Plan Wellstone: Conspiracy, Complicity, and the left.” by Anu Bonobo of The Fifth Estate [Detroit] 1 Apr. 2004, 36. It was an interesting take on "conspiracy theories" from an anarchist perspective. The point being that it seems that rightist elements in the "conspiracy theory" milieu seem to accuse leftists of being controlled opposition or lackeys of the supposed "New World Order," and as such many leftists, in response, tend to back away from "conspiracy theorists." Yet, in so doing, both sides are alienating themselves from each other. CT's might miss out on developing a meaningful transformation into an egalitarian society while parts of the left might be missing out on the CT's premise of phony state &amp; media pretexting for war. Anyway, I strongly recommend Hofstadter's book which is available for free as pdf.

Spoiler, the person who wrote the blog doesn't believe in the illuminati. From the post: "We believe Illuminati theory is wrong, and we wrote this pamphlet to offer a different answer."

Conspiracies do happen, and explanations provided by "conspiracy theorists" shouldn't be ignored, but rather examined and compared against other explanations. 
-----==----==---==-----
 This may seem outside most people's field of interest, but I think conspiracy theorists (and leftists in general) could benefit from studying evolutionary biology. Outside of the USA, and even in it in science, questions about "design" ie "conspiracy" were settled almost 100 years ago. Much (most ?) leftist writing appears on the surface to resemble a "directing center" model on far too many questions. The model of 'natural selection' in the social sense offers an alternative that would help those who might be skeptical of the usual leftist 'shorthand', a shorthand that far too many leftists actually never question.
-----==----==---==-----
Conspiracy theorists lack concepts like solidarity. They tend to attack allies as co-conspirators. [Alex Jones called Wikileaks a CIA mouth piece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6AL9lWch28). They really aren't that good at building movements, because they are so suspicious and hostile to potential allies. 

They also seem to attribute every issue to their One True conspiracy theory. It becomes like a religion. Their analysis is anecdotal and ad hoc. It doesn't really examine institutions, social relationships, and power. Much like religions, they start with their assumption that the conspiracy is true, than they look at organizations through the eyes of the puppet master. So if I was a puppet master, I'd make wikileaks a CIA frontend. I'd plant agents to disagree with me and spread misinformation. These puppet masters have done so much damage already. Why wouldn't they do this? Wikileaks says they are against state secrets. But that's exactly what'd I'd expect an agent of the puppet masters to say.

If only we could eliminate these puppet masters, everything would fine. All you other oppressed people's concerns are trivial in comparison. In that respect, they similar to socialists who put the fight against capitalism above all other oppressions.The problem is they centralize all forms of oppression into one incoherent source.

-----==----==---==-----
Massive generalizations don't really tell us anything. You do have a point, but it applies to individuals and specific situations. The meme "conspiracy theorist" is meaningless as all humans have theorized on one or more conspiracy at some point in time. 
-----==----==---==-----
I don't really like the callous numbers game, but last I heard there was a dead cop, two dead chavistas and two dead protesters. I'm not sure that hyperbolic statements about the material manifestation of rhetorical leftist violence have much traction when you're ahead in the body count.

Is there a credible source to support the claim that the PSUV is endorsing vigilante killings? Or that the average chavistas are for that matter?

United States makes another play for Venezuelan oilbucks, government cracks down. Nothing special here.
-----==----==---==-----
consider a left POV regarding Venezuelan protests: https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/55909

Basically, the rightists numbers range around a thousand or two recently. You can see from the photos on the caracaschronicles site OP linked how minor these numbers are. What they lack in mass numbers, they make up for with fire. Dramatic, but empty and failing to link with the greater working class sections of Venezuela.

Compare that to the counter protestors, who march against the rightist aggressions, numbering in the tens of thousands. Socialists. Organized workers. Students.

It's not often.. Hell, I can't think of any good examples, where the counter-protest is ten times larger than the protest.

Most people can't be bothered to counter-protest. did OWS have counter-protestors that outnumbered us 10 to 1? Do housing foreclosure resistances have crowds of hundreds siding with the banks? This should give you some ideas of how incredibly not-popular these rightist protests are. They make up for their numbers with extremism, in hopes that the US state department will intervene. And with every one of those interventions, breathes more life into the rightists and their attempts at overthrowing and ending [the advances made over the past decade](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1a10ym/effort_post_why_was_hugo_chavez_so_popular_a/). In its place, the re-entry of international corporations which will seek to undo these advances, and subjugate Venezuelans under neoliberal policies.
-----==----==---==-----
I need to make this clear from an earlier thread. I know there are some anarchists protesting in Venezuela right now, they need to stop. The opposition is mostly a far-right wing movement and they will literally get co-opted and utilized to support their cause. A riot cop might kill one of ours and then Lopez's people will be like "OH GOD HE DIED FIGHTING FOR FREEDUMMMMM GO LOPEZ." 

Yeah the situation is shitty in Venezuela right now. As much as I detest left-wing authoritarianism, what chavez and his people have done to Venezuela is amazing. There was a lot of mismanagement and a lot of abuse, and they are an enemy of revolutionary marxism. I am not saying we should side with the pro-government forces. We should not commit ourselves to this cause or we risk being co-opted. But I think we can at least wish for a certain outcome to occur. Not even endorse, just wish.
-----==----==---==-----
There's the police, chavistas, right wingers, and cop hating youth. Most of the formal support for the revolts is coming from capitalists who are demanding "democracy" and are anti-commune. This being said the police in Venezuela are fucking police and even more than that they are especially corrupt. The rioters are not all bad, but a lot are it's kinda like Ukraine in that way.

I find it sad when anarchists resort to demonizing chaos or nihilism to defend anarchy. Order and chaos are illusions constructed by whatever hegemonic narrative exists in a culture to shape what should be expected. To some anarchists, anarchy is order, and to others, anarchy is chaos. To each according to their need, I say. On the nihilism point, nihilism is not apathy, political nihilism in particular is almost the exact opposite.

IDK the article reminded me of this.
-----==----==---==-----
Eh. Article is decently written, but it paints a whole narrative that *all* extremism is bad as well as showing how we can get neo-Nazis out of the movement. They reduce extremism and radicalism to bad family life, this may help the formation of radical ideals, but they disregard the *ideals* part of the equation.

People such as us are not radical because of bad family life, but because we truly believe in our cause. We hold these ideals to be true, and we fight for them. This is not a result of our hardships, but a result of our revelations. The bourgeois may like to say otherwise, in order to discredit any ideas besides sticking with the mainstream, but we are anarchists, socialists, communists, etc. because we believe in what we say and not because we're looking for an avenue to vent our anger.
-----==----==---==-----
The cheapest cure is a brick, pipe, bat, or crowbar.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;But the scheme also makes broader assumptions—for instance that de-radicalizing radicals is a science, and an exportable one, such that former members of al Qaeda, an American fundamentalist cult, an LA street gang, and a clique of Swedish skinheads may be deprogrammed in similar ways. If this is true, then maybe radicalization has little do with the particular form of ideology offered, and more to do with a certain indefinable something that leaves individuals susceptible to the firm embrace of extreme groupthink.

This is some next-level bullshit. Oh, yes, you know that "certain indefinable something" that makes you fight back against imperialist aggressors or band together with other members of your community to survive? Yeah, it's terrible, we have to get rid of it. No wonder governments are funding this shit, it serves their interests perfectly.

Abolitionist would be cool but I'd have no idea how to make it into a flair
-----==----==---==-----
I think the plethora of ignorant comments about how we should be colorblind really demonstrate the need for the flairs.  
  
I'm pretty impressed with the mostly patient, rational anti-racist responses to those ignorant comments, which is not to denigrate angry call-outs, which of course poc have every right to make, and do not owe white folks any niceties.

&gt;This is not our war, but the victory of the government will mean the defeat of the workers. The victory of the Opposition also does not promise anything good. We cannot call the proletariat to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the Opposition and its interests. We think that the extent of participation in this conflict is a matter of personal choice. However, we encourage all to avoid being drafted to serve in the internal military forces controlled by Yanukovich, and to sabotage by all means available the actions of the government.


-----==----==---==-----
Well, at least the statement mentions the point of contention:

&gt;In the event of the Opposition’s victory life would be far from perfect as well. Although fascists form the minority of the protesters, they are quite active and are not the sharpest tools in the shed. A few days of truce in mid-February lead to conflicts between the rightist groups, resulting in several pointless and violent confrontations, as well as attacks on ideological ‘heretics.’ Besides the fascists, old and experienced Oppositionists will also attempt to seize power. Many of them already have some experience with working in government and they are no strangers to corruption, favoritism, and the use of budget funds for personal purposes.

Just saw in the /r/worldnews sticky there are links to the Svoboda radio.
-----==----==---==-----
Ah, supporting globalism under the guise of being against the government.  These protestors, like occupy, want MORE government and globalism, not less.
-----==----==---==-----
tl;dr "shit's fucked up."
-----==----==---==-----
I think it works at times, but it's difficult and largely unsuccessful. One important historical lesson is that soldiers have often turned on their commanders, but police seldom do the same. This is almost certainly in large part because soldiers are usually conscripted, but even in the modern U.S. armed forces which are completely "voluntary," I hear a **lot** of soldiers with some really radical criticisms and analysis. Read into that what you will.

In the past, divide and conquer has worked to some extent - racism was incredibly pronounced in U.S. soldiers' lives during the Vietnam War, and when the commanders were white while the cannon fodder wasn't, a lot of effective agitation took place. When Muhammed Ali famously said, as to why he wouldn't go fight in Vietnam, "ain't no 'g\*\*k' ever called me a 'ni\*\*er,'" it resonated with a **lot** of people, including U.S. soldiers of color. It's actually a pretty incredible quote, because it directly and indirectly criticizes about a dozen different systems/policies in just those few words - the kind of synthesis that's essential to a real revolutionary consciousness.

In more recent history, the story of the initial Egyptian Revolution of the "Arab Spring" is a perfect example of the armed forces siding with the people against the state. Unfortunately, in that case, they ended being no less tyrannical, but in the heat of the struggle, they did in fact disobey, and that's significant.

Anyway, I'm rambling a bit. I think this question is definitely best explored through history, and if anyone else has some historical insights to share, I'd love to learn about them.
-----==----==---==-----
I think you're incorrect about the Nazis. These sorts of questions were asked during the Nuremburg Trials; why did they do it? What makes a person obey orders to commit genocide? Didn't any of them consciously object and rebel?

The conclusion they arrived at was that there was a culture of obediance among Germans. Following orders was just what you did; questioning orders was just not proper. They didn't ever see themselves as responsible for what they were doing, they thought individual conscience was reserved for one's own personal choices, orders transcended individual conscience. Even when some few may have had doubts about what they were doing, they still carried out their orders.

Cops and soldiers are the same. Many may rationalise carrying out their orders as "It's just a job", but there is always that subconscious belief in obeying orders which reinforces that position. When you talk to a cop, you're talking to the uniform, not the person in it. It's what they're trained to do: be a rock, don't think unless it benefits the enforcement of your orders, don't engage with those who question your legitimacy, react with violence when you feel yourself being caused to doubt your enforcement of the law.

Never talk to a cop without a lawyer present.
-----==----==---==-----
You would be surprised how many Anarchists join the military and how many Anarchists the military produces.

There are several anarchist groups that work directly with soldiers. Start with Winter Soldier Iraq Afghanistan groups.
-----==----==---==-----
I would say its a matter of choosing your battles.  Obviously if someone fighting for the state is a friend or relative it makes sense to talk with them.  If that is what you are looking to do that is.  

On a more practical level I would say it could depend on your location.  And even more so, you need to separate police/military because your average younger cop in big cities these days is extreme right wing.  Like, you wonder why you hear about crazy conservatives, weird pop up churches and shit but never meet these people.  It's cause a ton of them are cops.  Trying to appeal to these people is essentially a lost cause, like if the Greek anarchists were appealing to the riot police.  Not a worthwhile cause.  
-----==----==---==-----
Yes. The common police officer is a victim of the system, just as we are. They are being used as a pawn in the game.



Education of all is key.



To an extent, yes, we can.
-----==----==---==-----
Well, the very role of the enforcer is to remove the capacity for critical thinking, so it's an especially difficult task. Empathy, imagination, and ideological skepticism become more difficult to develop the more years authoritarian routines shape a person. Nevertheless, I think this is one of the more important topics to learn more on.  
  
Defensive violence certainly has its place, but if I wanted to undertake the mostly useless task of trying to persuade a cop or soldier to question authority, I would look at the proper setting and framing. For example, when they are out of uniform would be a must, and they would need to already have emotional priming with their own doubt about their role, or some other crisis of faith that makes them more receptive. From there I would just use the psychology of the power process. People need participation in decisions, belonging to group &amp; place, purposeful effort, achievement-by-effort, intrinsically valuable effort, competence in abilities, confidence in role, recognition of contribution, respect from peers, respect for peers, autonomy, engagement / flow (losing oneself in the task), feedback &amp; progress.  
  
Arguments that implicitly or explicitly appeal to those basic needs will be more effective, which points out both the avenue for change, as well as the inertia since the system meets several of the enforcers' psychological needs and thus makes them less inclined to question it. I think it would be important to do as much as possible to link arguments about their interests (e.g. the shittiness of taking orders sometimes or not having say in decision that affect them) with arguments that create empathy and identification with the oppressed (would you have enforced segregation by race -&gt; then why do you enforce segregation by wealth? -&gt; it could be your kids on the other side some day).  
    
Anyone got any case studies?
-----==----==---==-----
For various reasons: Soldiers, yes. Police, no. 

I have some stuff to do, so I'll have to make this quick. Nearly anyone can enlist, and many do it exclusively for economic reasons (GI Bill, job security, US citizenship, etc.). This means that soldiers are much less likely to buy into the violent ideologies that justify imperialism. In my experience as a private in the US Army, many enlisted people had libertarian, anarchist, or socialist ideals and values, and many more described life in the army as similar to prison or slavery. Soldiers are generally not more nationalistic than the average person, nor more desirous of exerting power over others.

The pig, on the other hand... it is not easy to become a pig. You must firstly be in a privileged enough economic position to go to college for several years to study criminal justice and get a degree. This is something you have to set your sights on and work towards for years before you can get a badge. No one becomes a pig because they have few other economically viable options - *they want to be pigs*. Secondly, as opposed to soldiers (who sometimes do set themselves apart from civilians in their minds, but usually in an "aw shucks, a civvie *would* do that!" sort of way), the pigs view other citizens as a definite out-group. They view other citizens as people who must be controlled. They have been trained to use violence against people who do not submit to their will, and they are aware that there are little or no consequences for using violence against other citizens. 

tl;dr soldiers and pigs have very different mindsets re: the civilian population and would have very different reactions to either education (soldiers oftentimes are receptive to anarchism, pigs are not) or revolution (soldiers would likely not use violence against american citizens, pigs routinely do use violence against american citizens).

p.s. sorry for american-centric description, but that's where my experiences come from, ymmv

Ukraine is in a fight whether they will be looted by the west or the east.  Russia is pulling hard to bring Ukraine back into the fold, while the west is trying to destabilize the government to bring in a new one that leans west.

The west does not want to see Russia recreate its empire, while the EU and NATO are trying  to create their own.

The people in Ukraine are caught in the middle.

The .01 percent are not monolithic. While they have overlapping desires in terms of nobody else having power,  Everyone of them wants more.  They can't share the Ukraine so they will capture it or see it destroyed.  I'm thinking Russia will win this one, because the west can't start WW3, and Russia will kill everyone if it comes to it.

The protests aren't anarchistic to begin with?
-----==----==---==-----
Your metaphors are too crude and simplistic. Nobody owns the government. The 1% have disproportionate influence but they are not unified in their goals like a secret cabal. They pull the puppet every which way. Look, for example, at the policy recommendations of Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Matt Damon, Mel Gibson and Charles Koch. They are all the 1%. Do they pull government in the same direction? 
-----==----==---==-----
I can't speak for the Ukraine, but most of the revolutions we've seen in the past involve the US government supporting some totalitarian sect and the media treating it as if the people revolting represent an idea everyone else supports.

I completely agree we need to target the corporations and moneyed interests. Just be aware that most of these revolts are neo Nazis or radical Islamists or some other group that is interested in power for powers sake and are the kind of people we want to take power from.
-----==----==---==-----
If you attack the 1% another 98% will rise up to defend them, because a) they've been indoctrinated to defend the system and b) many of the 1% are relatively guiltless of any crime. They just did well according to society's standards. 1% is millions of people in the US. It probably includes your dentist and the surgeon who saved your mother's life. It includes Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock. You are not going to foment a popular revolution by burning down Sandra Bullock's house.
-----==----==---==-----
Most people in our capitalist nations hold these two beliefs to some degree:

 - The government is supposed to look out for the people. 
 - Corporations are supposed to look out for themselves. 

If you start a movement against corporate influence in politics, your opponents will be able to exploit these widely held beliefs to confuse the issue and distort your message. "Class warfare! They are just jealous of our success!"

I think cleaning up a a dysfunctional government is easier to rally around. 

(This is all assuming you want a movement with fairly broad support and decent PR.)
-----==----==---==-----
Like smallpaul said, it's unrealistic to imagine those corrupting powers as having a unified agenda. They're capitalists, they'd kick each other out if they had the chance. On the other hand, the government *is* a unified entity, and are the ones who have been given the right to kill people/throw them in prison/etc. The mob of 'puppet masters' would be useless to have any influence without the government they had been leaning on. I can't imagine any scenario where the 1% are able to establish themselves as law after the toppling of the government.
-----==----==---==-----
I agree with Orwell in that the real revolution must happen in the minds of the masses. Remove the power structure and the idiot masses will simply replace it in time.

No system of government can resist the corrupting influence of wall street groups or mega corporations, because all systems rely on people to carry them out.

All humanity can do to escape this cycle is to no longer feel it necessary to create these systems, to become enlightened and self governing. How I can't say, but I can say that Animal Farm is not a children's story about pigs and horses.
-----==----==---==-----
I think this is a valid if confused question, I would think about it in a more general sense and not put Ukraine into the equation unless there is some specific point you wanted to make in regards to it.  

It's useful to examine the mountain of absolutely useless protests though for sure.

What are you, a 12-year-old?
-----==----==---==-----
Let me explain what is going on in Venezuela. 

Basically, about 14 years ago Hugo Chavez was democratically elected as president of Venezuela. He won. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1998#Results It turned out that poor people really loved him because of his economic policies and the nationalizing of the oil industry. http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/8064 http://www.businessinsider.com/hugo-chavezs-venezuela-2013-3?op=1 He had a very low approval rating 3 years in and just passed a series of controversial laws. So, the united states government helped orchestrate a coup. They  captured Chavez, but he was soon let free because he was literally saved by the people. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Venezuelan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt Nevertheless, after the coup he was slightly more weary. Soon he tried to shutdown political opponents, especially onces that participated in the coup. Do you know Lopez, the leader of the opposition - the guy who is crying "Democracy for Venezuela!" Well, he participated in that coup of a democratically elected president and even illegally arrested and fired the minister of internal affairs.  So, after Chavez regained power, he banned him from holding office with no trial. http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/10365 Lopez objected to this saying that it violated the very constitution he introduced, but a lawyer from the GAO said that the constitution didn't give due process to crimes of corruption. http://www.embavenez-us.org/_neworleans/index.php?pagina=news.php&amp;nid=4924  In that article it shows you how he was tried before a court composed of a committee representing countries all over the Americas. After this, as well as increasing anger among the right in the country and america getting more and more pissed off at him, he wanted to consolidate the power of his party and himself, so he began to give more power to himself. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_constitutional_referendum,_2007  This trend of authoritarianism would grow over time. He would fluctuate in popularity but would always be more supported than detracted. Venezuela continued to improve in quality of life even as crime spiked and inflation began to increase. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-07/venezuelans-quality-of-life-improved-in-un-index-under-chavez.html Now there is massive inflation and price controls in place so the Venezuelan economy is very turbulent right now. Chavez dies, Maduro takes over. He's not as competent or willing as Chavez, I think that other dude should get it. Seems much more politically savvy. Not Lopez, the guy in the SDP. 

Anyway, so an election takes place and the conservative party lost by a very close vote so they think it was a rigged election. (don't need a source ofr tyhat.) They go out into the streets  and start protesting. The government sends out the riot police and.... well riot police gonna riot police. (or that.) Obviously they respond pretty brutally and a few reactionaries get killed. (or that) Last I checked though the body count was 2 dead on the government side (the cop and that revolutionary guy) and 5 dead on the rebels side. http://www.onenewspage.us/video/20140220/1634694/dead-in-Venezuelan-protests.htm So, it's not like this huge scenario of asymmetrical violence we are being lead to believe. Yeah the cops are being way too brutal and authoritaria, no doubt about that. However, it was not a rigged election. http://www.cepr.net/index.php/press-releases/press-releases/statistical-study-shows-that-first-audit-of-venezuelan-election-is-decisive Click on the paper then download the pdf at the bottom.

If I could sum up the situation, it would be an authoritarian, mismanaged government that's done a lot to help the poor but also made some pretty huge mistakes versus a reactionary group of bogie kids (these are student revolts. Students in venezuela are all gonna be loaded as fuck.) Just look at some of the dead kids on the rebels side, i know at least 1 was pretty well off. 

I am a committed insurrectionary anarchist, so I do not support authoritarianism whatsoever. However as far as leftist authoritarians i am impressed with the SDP party. 

The reason why Chavez and the SDP stood in power and are still in power is because of one fact: When you're dirt poor, you don't give a fuck about freedom of information, speech, which politician got blown up where, ect. keep this in mind. Now, before Chavez took power, there was about a 68 percent poverty rate in Venezuela. The poor were basically left out of the political process, most politicians would throw a bone or two but would never really dedicate themselves to it. Chavez was different, Chavez constructed himself as the savior of the poor. In some ways he was, because the poverty rate is now half of what it was before he took power. 

So even though Chavez turned into an authoritarian douche, the poor still loved him because who the fuck cares if some right-winger got thrown in jail for no reason, you have food on the table, a shot at education, and increased healthcare. 

Anyway, I'll answer your questions now.

A good source would be http://venezuelanalysis.com/ 
Also try Al-Jazeera, yeah yeah state-owned but they got good shit.

Chavez censored the media during the 2002 coup, because the media was literally encouraging everyone to join the coup and overthrow Chavez. There was literally only one channel, all the media channels were against him. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Venezuelan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt#Media_role
Yeah, he reduced poverty a lot. already provided a source fro that.

He won his last election at 55 percent, not 90. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012 

"I've heard he is speaking public about supporting worker's militias now, to aid against the opposition, smells fascist to me."
How is this fascist? 

Ultimately, when it comes down to who you should side with, I'm siding with Maduro. By siding I don't mean "endorsing" but I don't want the opposition to win.

There's other folks out there with similar ideas. Find them. 
Also Black Coffee has the cheapest coffee I've ever found on caphill and it's less shitty than starbucks or bauhaus or any of that shit so...also it provides hella rad space where you don't have to pay hangout rent and the old inhabitants of the neighbourhood don't get kicked out for ruining the vibe. They also maintain a cop and politician free space and have a rad distro. Idk make friends and shit will happen. Shit seemed like this a short time before all that anti-cop shit happened so yeah.
Shit is still networked it just shifted a bit, there was drama, stuff shut down, new stuff reopened and more stuff is up and running. MAKE FRIENDS :D FORM COMMUNES :3 BECOME THE TERRITORY :] The pigs can't hurt us as much as we can hurt ourselves.

boo, gender binary :\
-----==----==---==-----
The ambiguity of the statement really leaves it open to either descriptive or prescriptive interpretations, which is problematic. In the descriptive sense, do "I believe in the complete equality of men and women"? No, it is not factually correct, because women are discriminated against and oppressed in countless ways, that's the whole problem. Just like with race, poc are not equal to whites, because we live in a white supremacist culture. Of course women &amp; poc *should not be oppressed*, that's part of why we're anarchists, but the statement itself could be read to not address the *should*. Hume discusses this as the is-ought problem.  
  
I think most anarchists also acknowledge that we'll need to at the least drastically re-work our notions of "manhood" and "womanhood" and move toward less binary frameworks. Then there's the ambiguity of "equality"...equal rights, equal opportunity/access, equal outcome? What does it mean? I think we need to be more precise with our words. It's also worth considering equality v. liberation, which is not to ignore patriarchy or cis-het-male privilege, quite the opposite in fact, I hope we can do more than work to make the two boxes of patriarchy more "equal". I don't want anyone to have to perform a "man" or a "woman" role if they don't want to, and I think it's important to deconstruct them as normative symbols.

I think its agreed, men and women should be equal, the "fucking" demands we shouldn't judge people for their sexuality, and implies we all do our best to get eachother off sexually to de-comodify sex.

I have a friend who told me I can't be a feminist because as a male I cannot understand the female experience and what it means to be opposed for my gender. She knows a lot more about feminism than I do so I just kind of defer to her in this situation. 

Edit: Why exactly am I being down voted? I don't have the knowledge to refute this kind of statement, but it does feel wrong to me. I thought maybe I'd start a discussion here, but nope, just down votes. Every time I try to discuss this stuff with this friend she schools me with her gender studies knowledge or I say something stupid that offends her. I would consider myself a feminist but like I said I don't understand enough to refute her statement. 
-----==----==---==-----
If you're not a feminist, you CANNOT be an anarchist. PERIOD.
-----==----==---==-----
Isn't the belief in complete equality of men and women just a branch of egalitarianism? Or is feminism just a branch from that?
-----==----==---==-----
I believe in the liberation of women from the tyranny of the patriarchy. Honestly don't give a fuck about men as we are the embodiment and socialised manifestations of patriarchal domination. Liberation of the oppressed and by the oppressed must come first - equality may be implied in liberation but liberation is ultimately a position of negation.

How does naming the belief in complete equality of women and men "feminism" promote the belief?  Gender is no more divisive than nationality, race, creed, or religion.  No matter what the website says, I'm not a feminist.  I'm a humanist.
-----==----==---==-----
So anarchist.
-----==----==---==-----
Yes, I am fucking a feminist. It's moral AND enjoyable!
-----==----==---==-----
This is bullshit. I believe "women" shouldn't aspire for equality with "men". That fucking stupid as hell.

Complete equality between any two things is undesirable anyway. Anarchists don't strive for "equality". Never did.

You get what you deserve regardless of gender, to each according to ability. Operate outside the scale of gender instead of following their definitions. Fuck men. Fuck women. Fuck equality. 
-----==----==---==-----
After reading about it for a bit, I realised that I agree with the premise of it. Yes, people should be equal. I mean it, equal. Gender, age, race... None of it matters. However, I hate the fucking word they chose for it. Feminist..? Really. That's not good. It seems like we want to raise females on a pedestal when we use that word. Some people actually think it is. Most of those entitled, asshole "feminists" have no clue what the fuck they're talking about, nor the capacity to do so. Therefore, I propose a better word. Equality. We are all defenders of equality and liberty. That's why we find the idea of anarchy good. I don't think any of us believes that trying to artificially raise females position in current society will do anything. Thus, we find anarchy. Anarchy is the last thing on the list of things for a solution to our problems. Others come on top because they're easier. They are not effective though. Anarchy is the hardest one. It comes naturally, yes. But it's premise contains no mention of evil or good. Therefore, it is scary to many. But nonetheless, we find it nice. Because it is a chance for equality. *Not for some asshole to yell out they're being oppressed or that they're being discriminated.* We know that's already the case. No one needs to specifically say that. 
-----==----==---==-----
There's something wrong, I said yes and it told me I was a feminist.
-----==----==---==-----
This made me laugh. Yes, I am a fucking feminist. :p
-----==----==---==-----
I'm totally down for smashing patriarchy, etc.

But this is a terrible test. Nobody will ever be "completely equal" to anybody else. What does that even mean?
-----==----==---==-----
What does this have to do with Anarchism? How does Feminism affect the struggle in Ukraine right now???
-----==----==---==-----
So what exactly are all those "femenists" who think women are better than men &amp; believe they deserve better rights than us?
-----==----==---==-----
Men and women are not the same. Edit: Equally human but not the same.

Well, to quote **from the sidebar**

&gt; Anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems of control including but not limited to the state, capitalism, racism, sexism, and religion. Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of their community.
-----==----==---==-----
For starters it is two entirely different things. As in: ancap-ism is *not* anarchism. 

http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secFcon.html
-----==----==---==-----
Anarchism is primarily an anticapitalist movement - the abolishment of the state is viewed as necessary in order to prevent the lingering and eventual reestablishment of capitalist relations.

Since you mentioned East Asian anarchism as a whole, you may be interested in this piece on [anarchism in Korea](http://libcom.org/history/1894-1931-anarchism-in-korea). Both Korean and Japanese anarchists (like [Park Yeol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Yeol) and [Fumiko Kaneko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumiko_Kaneko), for example) were important in resisting Japanese imperialism during the 1890s-1930s.

I met with some really nice people at an anarchist info-shop in Tokyo last year.. We talked a lot about the far left in Japan, and how fucked up Japan is (institutionalized racism, closed borders, no workers rights and so on). In the 60s there was a broad uprising on the left (Called the "New Left", inspired by the student movement). After people started arming themselves and dividing into specific groups (wearing batches and wielding flags to show which political affiliation they belonged to), the whole movement collapsed in on itself in the 70s because lot of people started dying as a result of internal struggle. Here is an action that demonstrates the affiliation thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7L7Gq2o5fw .

[edit] Here is a summary from Narita who I met in Tokyo. http://irregular.sanpal.co.jp/?page_id=3826

From wikipedia: "The US-Japan Mutual Cooperation Treaty was successfully renewed in 1970 and students returning to work left the New Left groups virtually deserted, with only career leftists remaining. The groups split into dozens of warring factions and internal violence, which had been occasional up until then, grew ever more severe." 

Some groups moved to the countryside starting communes, but I haven't gotten around to read up on that. If someone were to write an in depth article about the radical left in Japan I would be very happy, as it is an extremely interesting subject. You also got the "Japanese Red Army", the Japanese equivalent of RAF, responsible for the Lod Airport Massacre.

As far as I know, there were a lot of anarchist intellectuals and sympathizers around 1900, but they faced severe punishment and in many cases execution. There are a lot of articles and literature easily accessible about that, like this: http://libcom.org/history/articles/anarchism-in-japan

Anyways, here is a great book i got in Tokyo about the struggle against French colonialism in Vietnam: http://www.cddc.vt.edu/bps/vietnam/index.htm
-----==----==---==-----
BTW There were anarchy state on the part of Ukraine 1918-1921 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Territory
-----==----==---==-----
There's three potential issues that need to be said. One, that we could be throwing resources to the same kind of people that went non-profit-neolib on us with Occupy. You know, the ones who used it to up their job and pocketed the grief that followed. Two, what kind of resources? Would I fly there and start bashing skulls? No, I don't speak the language even, I don't have a place there. I got some money, but consider the first issue. Third, haven't we have enough foriegn intervention?

That said, nothing would please me more than to see anarchists start fighting the good fight there. They don't need to organize. I believe that in situations like this, your politics, affiliations, and what you had for lunch cease to matter. In these situations, the blood and fires in the streets is an equalizer. As this grows more intense, it becomes mainly an uprising of people, each unique but fighting together anyways. It's the few that hold off from the main group and try to fight their own battles how they please - those are the ones you need to watch because it doesn't usually end well if nobody notices.

Like in Syria, all the talking about who's fighting under what banner and why and who, or what their political ideology is, is all stuff that foreigners who have the luxury of time and state security theorize about. I'm telling you, the people in the streets right now aren't worrying about whether their neighbor favored Lenin, Trotsky, Mahkno, or Reagan. If so, not for long.
-----==----==---==-----
Are you asking if anyone from this sub would go like 'international bridages' all up and in if Ukraine became "the new spanish civil war"?
-----==----==---==-----
Depends. If they turn out violent and selfish (as many humans would) then of coarse not, but if they work together and show the merits of an anarchist structure then I'd fully support it. We need a good example for anarchism to show the world
-----==----==---==-----
Of course. The State, as well as the neo-fascists, need as much opposition as possible.
-----==----==---==-----
Anarchists in Ukraine are already organized, so I do not get your question. 
-----==----==---==-----
in what capacity?

I can guaruntee morale support, but not much else. I appologize.
-----==----==---==-----
Stupid question. If I were in Ukraine, it'd be easier to help them. Being in the American Midwest, I think my efforts have their best effect here. Being on the internet, I think my efforts have a marginal effect.

-----==----==---==-----
If comrades there wanted my help I would go if I had the resources to get there.
-----==----==---==-----
I'd totally join, so long as I can be a part of their central leadership.
-----==----==---==-----
Not until they are feminist and include PoC as well. We do not need a group of macho white Anarchists smashing windows and playing dress-up without a strong social justice foundation
-----==----==---==-----
Organized anarchy? Isn't that a direct contradiction... 
-----==----==---==-----
Panic, flail about, cause widespread human extinction.

In any society the different kinds of situations will call for different kinds of organizations. Now The future of the planet will mean there will have to be some carbon neutral power source. Fusion is a long ways off. Solar and wind are nice but are constrained by the amount of rare earth metal. That leaves nuclear. There will have to be some nuclear power. There is no way around this.

Now there is the business of running maintaining and inspecting these facilities. So we have to figure out who will be running the stations and who gets a say in its operation. Since these stations can potentially affect millions of people. Well there has to be some form of representation so the concerns of the population are addressed. ( making sure these places are run well and have safety measures in place. 

Now without going into a long tangent on what hierarchy is or isn't, im going to play devil's advocate. David Harvey made a funny quip about anarchists running nuclear powers station and how he wouldnt want it. He was simply illustrating maybe a horizontal structure wouldnt work in a nuke power planet. He said that this kind of station required tight controls. Now I am not in this industry and have no idea how these plants work now or could potentially work in the future. To me its not a failure of anarchism if a nuke power plant runs horizontally. It could be that it might or might not. The interest of anarchism is making sure illegitimate hierarchy is dismantled. I think its legitimate to have a hierarchy if the alternative is nuclear post-apoc.

My feeling is that we will never know until we come to the bridge and what the people affected by such a decision would say.

EDIT: I really have to proofread
-----==----==---==-----
The engineers and other staff would keep working at the station if they choose to do so, or they'd safely shut it down if that's the wish of the surrounding communities.  

[Here](http://libcom.org/library/i-wouldnt-want-my-anarchist-friends-be-charge-nuclear-power-station-david-harvey-anarchi) is a thing that argues that nuclear power would be safer without hierarchies or cost-cutting measures.  
-----==----==---==-----
Why couldn't a nuclear plant be run by the workers?

Also, are hierarchies of merit necessarily authoritarian?
-----==----==---==-----
I mean it's not like all nuclear power plant workers are going to be dead. Even if for no reason we couldn't find anybody to turn the stations off, they have failsafes built into them in case of an emergency. 
-----==----==---==-----
Hopefully they would've been safely dismantled prior to the abolition of the state. Actually implementing any radical political change takes a great deal of careful planning. It would be plainly irresponsible for any anarchist faction to do away with the state before issues like this are taken care of.
-----==----==---==-----
in b4 OP realizes ridiculousness of said question.....
-----==----==---==-----
Easy, the workers have a few options. 
1: we use the nuclear power plants
2: we don't use the nuclear power plants
3: wait... thats it, its not that complicated.

There's way too much talk of 'an-caps' in this sub.
-----==----==---==-----
Hey, even shitty philosophies are technically philosophies.

The real problem is that ancaps don't actually have much hold on the word to people at large. It still popularly means chaos. That still makes them the only group to think they're anarchists (with exceptions. Sometimes the news calls certain ancaps anarchists, but usually for the purpose of demonization). I would rather fight the chaos rhetoric first.
-----==----==---==-----
Eventually they will run out of white men.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't think that's possible. Lots of political terms have a completely bastardized meaning in the US (socialism, communism, liberalism, libertarianism etc.), and as a very marginal group there's not really something you can do about it. And besides, everyone else associates Anarchism with violence and destruction, I don't think that's much better.

Police may not need to wear seatbelts because they would have to get out of their own cars quickly to respond to emergencies. You can also say that about Firefighters, they are emergency workers who need to take the risk of lacking seatbelts so they can jump off the truck/out of the other vehicles fast enough to save someones life.

Is there a radical subreddit version of /r/mildlyinfuriating?
-----==----==---==-----
It actually does come up here pretty often, with predictable results: there's the obligatory "no gods, no masters" and "all conceptions of god are equivalent to giving yourself a sky-boss," but then somebody says that's not necessarily the case plus something about Buddhism, and finally we all upvote the post mentioning /r/RadicalChristianity and move on.
-----==----==---==-----
 Not really on topic, but here's an interesting, perhaps apocryphal story from a reporter who was in Barcelona during the early days. He was up on Montjuis with an old anarchist watching the fires across the city, many from churches, convents, etc.. The old anarchist was proud. He said to the reporter, "Before we are done we will burn every church in Spain". Crossing himself he said, "This I swear in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost".
-----==----==---==-----
If it hasn't been mentioned, there is actually a Christian Anarchist flair (which I have).
-----==----==---==-----
I completely oppose the Catholic church. While it could be socialist, it can never be anarchist. Papal supremacy, the defining characteristic of Catholicism, is inherently hierarchical.
-----==----==---==-----
I am not religious but I think anarchists would be short sighted to dismiss the christianity of the gospels, liberation theology, other religious currents that have quite a lot to contribute. 
-----==----==---==-----
The spiritual side of anarchism for me has nothing to do with god. It is the love of freedom, the connection we feel with people we've never even seen, that we would fight for each other, the advance of good over evil.
-----==----==---==-----
I don't consider myself religious, but I am a christian. I've been wondering this too. 
-----==----==---==-----
Not sure whether I would be considered a proper "anarchist" but I'm a believing Muslim and an antistatist.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm curious which comes first for you? Would you believe in attempting to ban things that go against religous teachings or leave it to others to live their own lives if it doesn't affect you.
-----==----==---==-----
Damn, folks are really ripping on you in here. More power to you. I'm endlessly inspired by Dorothy Day, Catholic Workers, Peace Pilgrim, Daniel Suelo, etc. If it helps you in revolutionary ends, great - the language of the church is the *only* language of millions of people, politically, and anarchist revolutionaries must learn and speak it despite whatever misgivings they may have about the church.
-----==----==---==-----
I would say that while you could be an anarchist muslim, jew, christian, ect. this is limited to sects which are not centered around an institution (in this case, the papacy) that dictate the entire religion. People can interpret their own religion however they want, but I think one of the defining features of Catholicism is dogmatic obedience to the papacy. 

You are telling me you support an institution that has participated in massive amounts of genocide, participated in fascist movements, discriminates against women and sexual minorities, and goes into Africa and tells the people there to stop using birth control because it will give you AIDS. Yeah, no. That's some serious cognitive dissonance bro.

-----==----==---==-----
I'm quite late to this thread but might as well say that I'm a catholic anarchist as well! Also reading this thread seeing that there are other religious anarchists is pretty cool. Even though there's quite a lot of bashing its nice to know there's some like us!
-----==----==---==-----
Raised Catholic, don't mention it at all, because it doesn't matter what you believe as long as you don't shove it down other peoples' throats.
-----==----==---==-----
Most Anarchists are completely against organized religion as it is usually a vehicle for Facism. In Spain in the revolution the Anarchists destroyed just about every church they could using them as latrines. This is pretty against the grain for most western Anarchists but I do know some Buddhist Anarchists as well as many who are spiritual. 
-----==----==---==-----
The catholic church has its own political economic ideology dustributism. It just cant be anarchistic. You are a heretical non catholic.

A female police officer told GBI investigators that Roupe pointed a gun at her when he opened the door.

“It just doesn't add up,” said Cole Law who is representing the Roupe family.

Law said Roupe was about to watch a movie.

“We don't know where that statement came from. The eyewitnesses on the scene clearly state that he had a Wii controller in his hand. He heard a knock at the door. He asked who it was, there was no response so he opened the door and upon opening the door he was immediately shot in the chest,” Law said.

They don't say whether the father was then arrested.  If he was present, I'm sure he would have been.  Can you imagine watching your son shot to death, and then being pulled away from his body to be jailed for a parole violation?

Two completely separate questions. 

Vermin Supreme engage the electoral system as a sort of performance art/ satire. Interesting tactics to spread a left-leaning message, but not a real bid to build transformative power onto itself. 

Sawant's election was the result of political organizing that focused on building power in oppressed communities. Some anarchists might not support it, but I definitely do. This is not to say that focus on electoral politics should be the entirety of our program, but when it is effective and successful, why not support it? With Sawant's election we also get an empowered group of working-class and poor activists, and national attention toward the viability of building power around a class-based analysis of society. 
-----==----==---==-----
The only real prob I see with Sawant is Socialist Alternatives form. Like getting concessions is all fine, I mean I'd warn against making the state and capital more robust, but it's really the problem of having officiated authority within SA and all the resources being funnelled to them. 
As for Vermin I think comedy works better. 
I mean honestly more people are engaged in being entertained then are engaged in electoral politics.

This is a good way to consider it for sure, it shows plain and simple the type of people this ideology naturally appeals towards.  Middle class privileged people who believe that everyone has it just as easy and that those who fail do so on their own accord.  

With that said, I still think there's a considerable amount of people over in ancrapland that are honest and were searching for something and that was what they landed on.  This doesn't make up for the racists, nationalists, MRA's and general losers though.
-----==----==---==-----
Former "AnCap" here: I think one of the big problems with the "AnCap" community is that they don't bother to read up on the original meaning and history of anarchism. This leads to them to continue to believe, as they have been told, that anarchism is simply a system without a government. However, as I'm sure every one in this sub knows, anarchism is not that simple. Even if we look to the original meaning of the word anarchy as " without rulers" that already is a contradiction in their position since capitalism is a system built upon rule over others. 
-----==----==---==-----
Ive always thought that anarcho-capitalism was basically identical to a dictatorship. Each land owner is his own dictator over his own little country.
-----==----==---==-----
Anarcho-capitalism is a limitation of the imagination. You don't arrive at such a dumb idea by conclusion. It's just what they were left with. They know Capitalism is just as if not more detrimental to society. It's just that: What will they be left with if they reject it too? They're too fucking scared to consider the fact that our problems are deeper than the state. It would leave a gaping hole that they would then have to fill and with something *new* and *exciting*. Stop slapping "anarcho" in front of defunct sociopolitical/economic systems, you dolts.

"B-but that's t-too much work!" TOO FUCKING BAD. That's the point of Anarchism. It's a radical and imaginative philosophy. It's about doing away with stupid shit even if it's considered conventional or traditional. If that leaves us with nothing, then so fucking be it. That's more room to work. We don't want to settle with a "slightly better but still highly flawed" system, thanks. If we were open to that, we would have been or remained an /r/politics zombie; much less an anarcho-capitalist.

As MuzakNinja showed, the AnCap philosophy reduces humanity to merely machines. The world is not more than their conception of what it is. Private property reigns supreme, everything to them is a value, everything has a price. This is the thought process of a sociopath, where everything is only thought of in terms of "Is it profitable to me?" The rampant egotism, and the narcissism makes me sick.

What is even worse is that the AnCap has no conception of social freedoms whatsoever. They tolerate sexism, racism, nationalism, etc. as they only care about their own sacred private property "rights." Libertarians were fine with segregation in South Africa, libertarians are fine with the racism of today. They don't even fucking *think* about what is good for the rest of humanity, but what is good for *them* as individuals.

They only care about one freedom, and one freedom only: the freedom to obtain capital, everything else is expendable. You have the freedom to obtain capital as well, as a working person, but good luck when wealth is centralized into the hands of the few. You are not entitled to justice, because it is a commodity now. Justice for those who can buy the law-makers. You are not entitled to not be discriminated against for who you are, anti-discrimination is just a commodity now as well. Anti-discrimination is for those who can afford to pay for a good image or pay for a security team to not have themselves beaten for being of a certain race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. You are also not entitled to choose who rules you, because the one with the property rules, not the ones without property.

And they call us oppressive. I laugh at the thought, we care about the freedoms of society instead of just the freedom of individuals, that is the crucial difference between AnCaps and anarchists. We give a fuck about the *rest* of the people *without* property in this world, and the things troubling our society such as discrimination, racism, starvation, oppression, etc. This is what sets us apart from them: we are socialists, they are capitalists; we care about society, they don't; we do not tolerate oppression and they will so long as they have their property.

The capitalist cannot comprehend that he does not own himself privately -- cannot comprehend that all men are born as part of the whole that is the human race. 

He believes in his heart that competition among men creates a better humanity than solidarity among men - but I say, look at the damage that competition among men causes: war, man made famines, murdering for trade goods (De Beers), artificial supply shortages, the wilting of our planet which no man can own, and the worst of all creations: poverty. 

There are men wealthy enough to feed the entire world. This is the vital flaw in capitalism.

Edit: Sorry for admixing individualists and capitalists. I fixed it.

Lol at all the mad AnCaps in here. [MFW](http://gfycat.com/AncientEasygoingAcaciarat)
-----==----==---==-----
people like to pretend the problem with an-caps is unique to an-caps, but its not.

the problem with ancap is capitalism. There is no form of capitalism that is not exploitive. If you have a large state to regulate private companies, it becomes exploitive. If you have no state, the companies are exploitive. If you have a mix, they are both exploitive, and vy for control, turning the people against eachother, and destroying things with a battle for control.

the NAP is not a bad idea by itself, but what makes it terrible are capitalist property rules on private property, and lack of recognition of personal property. (even valid law enforcement teqniques become hideiously oppressive when you enforce bad laws)

an-cap dedication to personal freedom is amazing, but allowing land owners, company owners to arbitrarily regulate on their own turf is oppressive.

Again, the biggest problem with anarcho-capitalism is the capitalism part. Once you start recognizing private property, non-democratic ownership, and non-democratic groups, all other rights become subjective really quickly
-----==----==---==-----
AnCaps also grow huge mustaches which they twist evilly as they plot against you.

You forgot to mention that.

When you see a Murray Rothbard bow-tie, its sort of like a secret sign of, "Owing to my profession I cannot grow a mustache, but I have a virtual one represented by my tie."
-----==----==---==-----
I've never heard an AnCap or anyone else for that matter say human beings are worthless.  Where does that come from?

The question is only about how to best allocate resources that are available and that is where economics and markets come into the discussion.

I might be in the minority here, but I don't think rights exist.  I think there are some facts about human behavior like, people prefer to have food when they are hungry, but I don' think there is a right to food.  This is because, if you are born in the wild, the  environment isn't necessarily going give you all the food you need unless you are willing to go out and get it.  Even then, there might not be enough.  That is not an evil ideology, that is just nature.  Scare resources are a fact of nature.  What is the best way to allocate those resources?
-----==----==---==-----
You're free to not engage with AnCaps, and you're free to look for confirmation bias from your likeminded peers. However, your assumptions remain inaccurate and misled. If anyone wants a more proper response from an AnCap sympathizer I'll be available to respond.

&gt;the lives of human beings are worthless in a general sense

&gt;Morally reprehensible and unselfaware quotes from actual AnCaps made in this thread during attempted brigading!

Is this serisouly the top post right now? I find this kind of embarrassing for /r/Anarchism to be upvoting so much. Yes, everyone here agrees with you, but all you've done is repeat those thoughts while slinging insults. The rest of the subreddit is things like relevent news articles and events, but *this* post is sitting at the top.

&gt;AYN-CRAPS HAVE LINKED THIS ON THEIR SUBREDDIT, THE BRAVE INTERNET LIBERTARIANS ARE HERE TO EMANCIPATE US FROM OUR ANARCHO-STATISM, FOR THEY ARE THE TRUE ANARCHISTS. HEIL ROTHBARD.

Listen to yourself, you're just a troll.

I'm reading through the comments right now, and I think I'm done with subscribing to /r/Anarchism. The levels of circlejerk and seething hatred is just too much. 
-----==----==---==-----
I feel like a large portion of people who identify as anarchists here are perhaps anarchist-leaning liberals. "Inalienable rights" are not fundamentally anarchist. And, in a stateless society, there is no guarantee of nor right *to* anything. This is not an anarcho-capitalist point of view, nor an ethical *should,* but just a statement of the facts of life.

Work is always required.

The only question is *who* works for *what,* and *who* controls the fruits of their own labour. Anarchism does not guarantee you a right to food, housing, health care, or survival in any fashion. You still have to create this for yourself. The goal is simply to create it *for yourself*, outside the confines of any form of authoritarian or exploitative structure. Anarchists have always been workers and producers. Anarchism is a movement of the *working* individual. Don't confuse work with capitalism.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;This conclusion I reached is rooted in AnCap ethics. 

&gt;As many know, the lives of human beings are worthless in a general sense

Actually, people are one of the most valuable resources on the planet. Just look at what we've accomplished. 

&gt;nobody is 'entitled' to food, housing, etc. Everyone must buy that, it must be paid for in a market environment, everything is a commodity to be sold right down to justice. 

Or you could just produce it yourself. That would be dependant on property rights though, wouldn't it? Hmmm...

No. A more accurate statement would be "people are not entitled to the labor or property of others."

By the way, *everything* is a market environment. 

&gt;Nobody has the right to justice, if you're raped and cant afford the courts? 

Because our current court systems are so fair, right? Theft, even with good intentions, is still theft. You cannot achieve morality through immoral means. Besides, are you suggesting that those greedy rich capitalists want rapists running around? Use your fucking brain.

&gt;Who cares! You are worthless, you are entitled to nothing as a human being.

My value comes from the fact that I'm not entitled. I work for what's mine. 

&gt;Disabled and abandoned by your parents? Well, fuck you! 

I guess the fact that private charities not only exist, but also donate more wealth to the needy than government, is a complete mystery to you. Why do you assume people are inherently evil?

&gt;Humanity has no inalienable right to life

Umm... the NAP pretty much covers that.

&gt;These inalienable rights are private property and the means to the protection of private property from outside aggression, the non-aggression principle in AnCap terms. Consider this; this is a system where the means to Capitalism and acquiring wealth/capital (private property) is LITERALLY more important than human life. You are more entitled to the ability to acquire capital than you are to your own life. 

That is completely ass-backwards. A philosophy advocating peace and non-aggression is out to take people's lives? If my body is my property, how under the NAP could someone deprive me of it?

&gt;Freedom folks. This is freedom. The world is one giant business.

The world IS one giant business, and guess what? Being a socialist society won't change that.

&gt;your lives are meaningless in this giant business

What would a company do without customers? Without employees? 
Capitalism cares about people because people care about people... and themselves. It is more profitable for companies to practice good business ethics. 

&gt;the only inalienable rights there are, are the rights to acquiring and holding capital. 

... I've never heard an an-cap say something like that. Most attribute the NAP to life, liberty, and property. 


&gt;Capital is before human life

Human life *is* capital. Human advancement requires capital.

&gt;this is a world literally deduced to the transfer of capital, the means of acquiring money, the process of business. 

Oh, such shallow minds that view money as the only form of capital. If I do something nice for someone, I still profit... even if money wasn't a factor. For being anti-capitalism you're fairly obsessed with money.

&gt;It is a world driven by greed and a complete obliteration of human spirit.

Are you suggesting that self-interest is a bad thing? That *is* the human spirit. Why? Because I understand that by helping others, I help myself. I also understand that there is no excuse for the initiation of force... even if the other person has something I want.

You're just jelly.

humans are good robots, easy to program and fun to make. they have no intrinsic value simp!y for existing. the only thing keeping you from getting raped is yourself. you can only own what you can defend. if your community depends on the garden for survival you'll defend it from invasive specoes , be it insects or animals including humans. suddenly the value of the private property has outweighed the life of other creatures. unless of course you don't value your own life of the other members of your family and community and are willing to give away your food water and shelter. 

there's still a lot of superstitious sentimentalism about universal rights and equality extending from some sort of higher power than humans. rights extend from the ones willing to enforce them, and the only thing greater than humans is nature itself. its this internal struggle which makes political systems unnatural and imposed on people, attempting to regulate and control them. 

the majority of the population has been conditioned to accept control to the point their only value is as a livestock type of commidity, interchangeable and replaceable drones buzzing around doing work for the Queen. the only thing that's really changed in the past 10k years is the about of people that can be controlled at one time. from radio, television, and the internet, programming is being done wirelessly.

It's an incredible waste of time to debate those who utterly reject economics, to debate those who are ignorant enough to think that real wages necessarily trend down, or that employers expropiate their employees *just* wages, or that a capitalist owner is nothing more than a heartless accountant, or that the free-market is inherently chaotic (booms and busts), or that "resources" are "infinite", etc. That level of ignorance can only be *wilful*, which betrays a staggering level of intellectual dishonesty. 

Ultimately, the irrational dogma foundational to dimwits like kaiserzero doesn't advance much beyond "Look at all this 'stuff'! Wow! There's enough for everyone! Let's put "everyone" in charge of all that 'stuff'! Hooray, we're all wealthy, and no one is hungry! I mean, it's so simple and obvious! How could it possibly fail??"

If you're looking for late 19th and early 20th century satire I suggest any of Mark Twain's work. Although he wrote about the world around him, his stories are littered with political and social satire
-----==----==---==-----
It's a stretch but I can't miss an opportunity to push my favorite book: The Sirens of Titan. Since it's Vonnegut it's really tongue in cheek which I loved. Philosophically it's the best book I've ever read. It delves deeply into the human condition and is a solid argument for hard determinism. There's many instances of resistance and finding reason in a world that seems so chaotic. I'd read it again if I possessed it.

excellent question, anarchist satire is certainly few and far between. the library lists five:

greatest satire ever.

Veganarchism is veganism and anarchism combined, but this has philosophical and practical implications that make it more than that. Veganarchists extend intersectionality beyond the speciesist limit of human struggle to include non-human animals. The hierarchies in society are dependent on all of the interdependent oppressions they maintain, including animal exploitation and commodification. Since the fate of all disenfranchised and exploited groups are interrelated, we believe that including animal liberation is an essential part of a praxis seeking total liberation.

I recommend reading [Brian Dominick's *Animal Liberation and Social Revolution*](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/brian-a-dominick-animal-liberation-and-social-revolution) for a primer, and come join us at /r/veganarchism.

[Discordianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism) is an absurdist pseudo-religion.
-----==----==---==-----
Autonomism is a particular sect of Marxism with very close similarities to segments within anarchism. Derived from the 1960's "Workerist" movements, along with some influence from Situationists, Anarchists, the social center/squat movement in Europe, and the autonomen. Some thinkers: Silvia Federici, Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, and Harry Cleaver. 

IMO, apart from a few examples, it's often damn near indistinguishable from anarchism apart from its immediate focus: where it derives from Marxist ideas on economics, anarchism originates its focus on authority and hierarchical social order. 
-----==----==---==-----
 Revolutionäre Zellen in Germany had links to the Autonmen, what now has become known as the Black Block came out of the North and West European Autonomen. Italy had also an autonomous movement in the early eighties. In practice it was a mixture of radical non parlimentary communist groups and militant Anarchists who were fed up with the endless debate about the use of violence and what whas violence in the first place.

Veganarchism: a sythesis of veganism and anarchism. The idea of no rulers implies that humyns should not rule over other beings as well.

Discodianism: I'm pretty sure this is a mixture of chaos worship, believing all the conspiracy theories are true, and witchy cult shit.

Autonomism: An anti-authoritarian philosophy coming out of the Marxist tradition. It's also a sort of cultural marker and a more recent tendency.

I went on a anarcho capitalist forum the other day and was Actually somewhat happily surprised. I never really engaged a ancap and assumed it was simular to capitalist libertarianism (I'll admit a mistake to assume and not learn) but these guys sound surprisingly a lot like us on top of that some of them seem to have more socialist tendencies than they'd like to admit. It seems to be more due to mental conditioning and fear of words that they haven't joined us.

The same could be said - and indeed has been said - of the aristocratic class in feudal society and the slave masters in slave society. Why are you surprised that the ones who benefit most from these systems have the means to keep it running? Of course only they have the means to begin the cycle and then benefit from the system, that's the point.     
  
But as Lincoln stated, and everyone else ITT has demonstrated, "Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration."

-----==----==---==-----
Marx's critique of the capitalist flows from his argument that any "investment" the capitalist makes is already the product of exploitation.  In Marx's labor theory of value, a commodity has value because it is the product of the combination of raw materials, which have no value, and labor, which creates value.  In traditional Lockean property theory, this is sufficient to create genuine ownership of the commodity in question.  However, for Marx, if the individual hires someone to do the labor for him, and sells the goods for profit, the worker is being cheated out of the value difference between his wage and the resulting commodity.  Because in a traditional Lockean interpretation he would own the product of his labor outright, the worker is entitled to receive the total value of his labor as compensation.  Thus any profit is actually stolen or exploited from the worker by the capitalist.  

Furthermore, the argument that workers are not entitled to their full compensation because they freely sell their labor ignores the systematic realities of capitalism itself.  Most laborers do not sell their labor out of mere choice, but coercion.  If they did not work, they could not eat, and because the capitalist has channeled the modalities of human interaction into the myopic duality of landlord/tennant, or classically Proletariat/Bourgeois, the only way for the worker to eat is to be exploited.  The only resolution to this situation, is to allow the worker to keep the total product of his labor in the form of collective ownership of the forces of production.
-----==----==---==-----
Go buy a hunk of raw materials and throw them in a pile. Come back to it in a decade and see if it's assembled itself into a product that you can sell. Good luck with your investment. Work is the predominant factor in production. *Who does that again*?
-----==----==---==-----
Where does he get the raw material from? Does he dig it himself? 
-----==----==---==-----
The workers produce all value. It does not matter whether or not the capitalist invests, the property relation itself is exploitative regardless.

From what I can tell this violence is probably going to continue, I'd say this is going to turn into either a Greece-esque situation (combination of parliamentary politics and pissed off protesters), or this is going to turn into an actual spring.

However, I'm going to add my opinion into this: both sides suck.

However, the anti-government side, protests for joining the EU (great...) and has elements of the far-right inside of it, e.g, Svoboda, formerly the Social Nationalist Party of Ukraine, [they had a wolfsangel for a symbol](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/I%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%8F_N%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D1%97.jpg) and had fascists in their midst such as the Patriots of Ukraine. You also have the Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian National Self Defence who [march in camouflage fatigues (reminds me of something, cough)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/UNA-UNSO_members.jpg). You also have militant groups such as Right Sector, which is a conglomerate of far-right groups including neo-fascists (a la the Patriots of Ukraine and the UNA-UNSO) and others (on their Wikipedia page they stated "White Hammer" was a part of Right Sector, that may be an ethno-nationalist group, not too sure though.)
-----==----==---==-----
Doesn't matter, there is no positive outcome to support. East-Ukraine's capital interests want to join Russia, West-Ukrain's capital interests as well as most of the liberals and democrats on the streets want to join EU. The rioters on the other hand don't care and are fighting for independent West-Ukraine, while the pro-EU opposition is trying to use the threat thereof to force a new election and hope for pro-EU outcome.

If the rioters win, you get a new extremely right-wing country that will join neither EU nor Russia. If the government forces win, they will collab with Russia. And if forced elections then Ukraine will most likely be going with EU.

Here's what I think is happening.  I was trying to figure out what was going on a while ago and am not sure how accurate my analysis is.  Please please correct me on anything that may be wrong.

This is about oil contracts and the putin circle vs. the bush circle.  It appears that the pm gave the oil contracts to the putin circle and then threw the person that gave the contracts to the bush circle in prison.

This is the bush circle of influence pushing back and staging a "coup", as is their usual modus operandi.  Putin can't be too aggressive or he risks marginalizing himself as being overly brutal.  This gives the advantage to the "rebels".  

I'm not saying that there are not **real people** involved in this.  There are and I do not want anyone to be harmed.  I am simply questioning the deep politics behind the groups that may have brought these people to action.

Anyone know anything more?  I could be completely off base.  This just seems to me like more rich people convincing others to fight their battles for them.

Just a reminder of how Canadian police dealt with protesters demanding more democratic accountability, less than two years ago:

Do you know what's funny, I saw some 'do gooder' Candian dooche writing on reddit "I am a Canadian, how can I help the protesters in Kiev?" 
Your government has already endorsed the hooligans there, you don't need to do anything...
 
Well you could help by coping the Ukrainian spirit and standing up against corruption in your own government, and then gouge out a cop's eyeball!

I mean, good for them for (presumably) realizing their wrongdoings and setting a proper example. 

But in all seriousness, it'd be cooler if they left behind some sorta manifesto, or at least used their insider access to do a little damage to the system before the fact. Or of course, seek mental health counseling/rehabilitation and not kill themselves at all.

Rothbard's dream has come true, we're entering the Age of Liberty!

*"Take Back the Streets: Get Rid of the Bums. Again: unleash the cops to clear the streets of bums and vagrants. Where will they go? Who cares? Hopefully, they will disappear, that is, move from the ranks of the petted and cosseted bum class to the ranks of the productive members of society."*

I posted this because I think the aesthetics of vaporwave point towards a very useful and interesting idea: that while cultural appropriation has historically been the tool of the kyriarchy to colonize and commodify struggling cultures, radicals can appropriate the culture of corporate capitalism to highlight the sleaze and alienation it thrives on; with the ultimate end of bringing to the surface and feeding the subtly anticapitalist assumptions many people have. 

Art and music are incredibly important tools for revolutionary movements. Folk was the stuff of the first wave, then rock, then punk, then (in some circles) rap. Our aesthetics and art need to evolve with the systems we fight. Punk is good, but punk's value as a vehicle to radicalism is waning in a lot of places. What's next? Vaporwave may immediately die and be a fad - but such short-attention-span cultural phenomenons may be the norm.

"This just in! Snowden says that the NSA digs through your trash!!! He also says that you need to drink more PepsiTM or the NSA nanobots will latch on to you!"
All snarkiness aside I dont think the NSA is Nearly as omnipotent as it says it is. Its convenient to have Snowden just chillin' in Russia "leaking" every little thing to make it seem like there is literally nowhere to hide. Who knows maybe there is nowhere to hide. But the MPAA said that in the early 2000's. I think information being disseminated aimed at striking fear into people is cheaper than actually having the infrastructure to do all those things. Hell the NSA data center cant even keep from catching fire. Its not that I dont think the NSA has some crazy spying capabilities. I just dont think they are as perfected as they are mad out to be.

Comparing individual gun rights and ownership with the national military complex... seems kind of like a false comparison to me. If I pull a gun on a burglar, it's not like I'm doing it specifically to gain wealth I wouldn't have had before, or to suppress their rights. My gun is being used defensively. That would be like a nation defending itself on its own soil by military force, in this comparison. The United states is an agressor, and ought to be compared not to a defensive gun owner but instead a racketeer or armed thug extorting protection money. 

Also, to equate the United Nations to the Police is false as well. The United Nations has now enforcing power in and of itself to prevent atrocities. The United Nations is like a legislative body which posts "no smoking" and "no loitering" signs in your community. Police would be more like the International Fleet of Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game. 

All in all, an anti-gun, false comparison. We should not trust police, should be willing to defend ourselves as individuals, and not be reprimanded as being like the United State's military empire for doing so.

It doesn't sound like it was positively portrayed, at least in the sense that it was just vague, I think that as an object of our collective past we need to accept that it happened and never shy away from it. The violent racism persists, I believe, because the people who aren't racist try to "move on", instead of embracing our turbulent past in order to truly change the future. We tend to write of crazy bigots as just crazy, when we should be addressing their bigotry directly, and by throwing the imagery of hate into our art in ways that call us on our past, and warn us not to forget, we can do that more effectively.

The driver dives into her purse and pulls out her mirror. Yep, that's it.

     Little Tony was sitting on a park bench munching on one candy bar after another.

    After the 6th candy bar, a man on the bench across from him said,

    "Son, you know eating all that candy isn't good for you. It will give

    you acne, rot your teeth, and make you fat.

&gt;Nevertheless, in 1953 he accepted a knighthood for "services to literature"; this caused Read to be ostracized by most of the anarchist movement. 

Yep, Leon C. shoots McKinley and we can't shake the association of Anarchists being violent for a century later but this guy accepts a title of nobility after writing something and we then ostracize him because we would show him respect when we call him 'Sir'.

It's not like he won medals in a huge war or anything. Oh wait.

&gt;He received the Military Cross and the Distinguished Service Order, and reached the rank of captain.

Oh he did get medals for his military service, but no anarchists ever thought to ostracize him based upon that, it's **the huge outrage** of calling them 'sir' because they're a knight (even though that's a formal honour rather than an actual rank... like captain).

He self-identified as an anarchist and you know what that's good enough for me.

Anarchism is more than just abolishing the state, in my opinion.

The process of anarchism is a social revolution.  It's radically altering how we think of each other, how we relate to each other, and how we work with each other.  

Anarchism is about creating communities based on self-reliance, respect, and autonomy.  It's about mutual aid, and helping those in need.  It's about cooperation rather than hierarchy and division.

The state does impede this vision, but its abolition alone will not bring anarchy.

Regardless, if this really picks off, it's very good agitation and brings anti-authoritarian ideals into the spotlight.

The Internet reaches out to a fraction of people in the US. 

Even with television you couldn't convince everyone. In order for this idea to work, 100% of voters can't vote. If just one person votes, who is to say that it *can't* be used against the idea. 

There are already a great deal of people that do not vote, for whatever their reasoning, and some of them do not vote because they don't believe in the current system. How do you change something without interacting with it?

I like to spread the phrase, "educate your vote".
-----==----==---==-----
Fuck that.

I vote socialist/green. Anarchism isn't necessarily compatible with representatives, but it certainly should involve itself in whatever limited democracy that exists. Or we could keep systematically shooting ourselves in the foot because we're too good to do what everyone else does. I'm sick of this defeatist lifestyle bullshit. You're simply wrong if you think having more people like Bernie Sanders representing us wouldn't ameliorate problems for the poor and even straight up save some lives. In the last round of elections I even voted for a Democrat by the name of Tammy Baldwin and I have no regrets. Reformism isn't the endgame, (this is /r/anarchism after all, no need for endless truisms) but it seems clear it's a moral imperative of those privileged enough to have the option to do what they can for those that have no voice at all. There's no voting for no one. Don't let your pride be the boot that stomps on the homeless and less fortunate. Like it or not someone is going to be elected and even President Obama is better than President Romney, but if we actually made an effort perhaps it could be even better than that. I understand the frustration and we definitely need to keep working through means outside the political system, but let's no toss out the baby with the proverbial bathwater, so to speak. We'll get there, but we're not even close yet.

Anarchists should always vote democrat because ~~liberals like me...~~  i mean...  anarchists like me ~~are actually dumb enough to~~ believe that there's a difference between the two parties and can't help but fall for the "lesser of two evils" nonsense.  

I mean...  no...  yeah...  vote democrat.

I assume most intelligent people will continue to vote for Nobody, and the moron majority will split their votes about evenly, depending on which of the two multi-millionaire Skull-and-Bones-men has the most sex appeal. It doesn't really seem to matter: if the people marginally prefer the "wrong" candidate, the Supreme Court will assuredly "correct" them again. The TSOG(Tsarist Occupation Government) seems a comfortable disease, like death by sleeping sickness. After 7000 years of Authoritarian Patriarchy, most people accept Tsarism and, in America, resent that pesky constitution imposed on them by a few intellectual freemasons.
