Hi Steve, do you think we're on the cusp of having a viable third party in the form of the LP? What makes you think so? I think there's a growing element of the electorate who is either looking for an alternative or beginning to see the advantages of libertarian philosophy. How do we maintain this momentum, attract financial backing, etc? Your thoughts? Thank you!

Here is the summary (with some assumptions made in my part; if my assumptions are correct, I have lost all faith in government)...

• Man goes through security and is stopped by two TSA supervisors

• They found lapel pins in his bag with the word "bitcoin"

• They believe they have found actual currency

• The man is interrogated, suspected of smuggling or laundering money via lapel pins

• The TSA demonstrates their own incompetence for all the world to see clearly
-----==----==---==-----
Meanwhile actual gold is *not* considered a currency. Bernanke's law.

I'm sure the criminals will ensure that they too are wearing their ID when they plan to commit a crime...

Sounds like the author hasn't even bothered to study libertarianism for five minutes. 
-----==----==---==-----
the opposition to libertarianism is always based in misunderstandings, appeals to emotion and outright lies.  They basically prove they have nothing.

I've heard the old Soviet Constitution had many lines a bit like this..."The freedom of speech shall by guaranteed to the people, except as restricted by law."

Thank you government for keeping me safe.

Canada has enshrined in its constitution the phrase:

- Peace, Order, and Good Government

which is so vague, it can be interpreted to mean pretty much anything to anyone depending on their political philosophy.

First off - thank you for your work. Cato does a lot of valuable things, and you should be proud to have been a part.

My question: what's your career path? What were you personally looking to get out of working with Cato, besides just helping your fellow man?
-----==----==---==-----
Credentials have been verified. :)
-----==----==---==-----
What research projects, if any, have you been personally involved with? Did you learn anything interesting from the findings?
-----==----==---==-----
What set of skills would you say are the most valued at such a think tank? Is there more pressure on science/data/maths skills or rather soft skills? Or a good mixture of both? Also - would you say that you feel you're helping people out? 

Btw, good job, man!

The education system needs a lot of fixing...
-----==----==---==-----
Any educators on here or taken a few classes? About a year ago I was taking some classes to get a secondary education license and I quickly fell out of favor with it. So much red tape it feels less like teaching and more like being in a TV show with an educative script. I butted heads with some of the students and the professor a couple times.

But it raises the question: what kind of education program  would be implemented to keep students in a "competing" education race? I think most in the education field are fearful of having students incompetent in some of the subjects or ignorant of particular knowledge. A few years ago a school county wanted to do away with US history, feeling it was unnecessary and hurting school grades. News reporters "quizzed" some students about US history including Revolutionary war, constitution, Civil Rights. Most got the answers wrong, and as a history major it irked me. Also what subjects will they teach and what standard of quality? The Federal level does get in the way, especially with money. But Common Core has been implemented for so long that most teachers are used to it, which sucks. Arizona was trying to get rid of it, whether they did I'm not sure at this point but that puts a lot of stress on teachers that have built their teaching methods around it.

I was with you right up until "on a wooden board next to a white dude in my cell". It was then that I thought, why was that important. As I read I realized that this article was quickly turning into a "cuz I'm black" drama.

&gt; “It’s the ‘broken windows’ theory of law enforcement in action. The concept is, you catch 10,000 little fish in your net, you get a couple of big fish, too. Too bad for the little fish.”

Americans are being conditioned to think this is normal. Don't drive with a dirty car, don't carry things in your pockets, perhaps avoid the trip to the store if you can, because it is inevitable that the police *can and will* eventually stop you on some pretext, or without any pretext just to check up. It is a policy where everybody is considered a potential criminal and must be prepraed to have their identity checked against a database on demand.
-----==----==---==-----
Look at the number of downvotes you white boys give to a libertarian article just because it's about a black person, LOL.  
-----==----==---==-----
This liberal bullshit belongs to /r/politics. The police don't arrest blacks and Hispanics more often because of racism, but because they commit more crime and are a high-risk group.
-----==----==---==-----
The internet is something that exists on the principals of libertarianism.
-----==----==---==-----
Libertarianism taken to logical conclusions is anarchism. Governments, on the other hand, are tools used to amass and gather power. This is why we will see few governments, in the past or in the future, that resemble libertarianism. It's like asking; "where are the libertarian dictators?" A system used to amass power for itself will not result in libertarianism. If a government, a system designed to retain power, is given *any* power then it will work to gain more, more and more.

There are many cultures, societies, geographical areas, that were and are largely libertarian today. Basically any rural area that is not close to a central authority. Many times the libertarianism of those areas even causes problems for the central authority: for example, rural refusal to pay taxes in Greece. Many of the rural areas of the United States and Europe today are largely libertarian. Anywhere in Mexico outside of the cities is largely libertarian. In fact, most of the world outside of major cities lives more or less with very minimal government influence.

The American colonists were largely libertarian, I think that they intended to create a system to protect that liberty, but the United States is a good example of how governments grow and amass power. The very systems used to protect liberty often become the same that take it away. 
-----==----==---==-----
IMHO the United States in their early history was somewhat libertarian. The Founding Fathers were classic liberals, and classic liberalism and libertarianism have a lot alike, so I'd say 18th-19th century US. And, as /u/JefBeau already stated, the internet, even though it isn't a "state" per se.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt; I feel like the practical truth of the matter is that more organized and authoritarian civilizations usually win over the less authoritarian ones. 

It's so easy to buy people off with handouts and people have been so willing to use government for "the greater good" (or so they think) that it's difficult to ever have a libertarian society that stays that way. "Do-gooders" eventually fuck everything up. Brings to mind the quote "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." 

I guess you could argue that this country was at least intended to be that way, or at least a close variant of it. 

My how far we've strayed.
-----==----==---==-----
This is a pretty piss poor article.  It fails to address the historical relationship between liberalism and conservativism, particularly in an American context.  Of course they're very similar, we're a liberalist democratic republic.  The "Libertarian" answers he provides merely shrug off the issues, rather than attempt to actually address them.  The current situation doesn't go away just because we ignore it.  It's so comically ignorant of the nuances of voluntarism, including people's right to collectivize and maintain society in the way they see fit.  If my local community wants to fund planned parenthood voluntarily, then we need to have a discussion about how to go about it.
-----==----==---==-----
This is a weak augment. You can compare the two philosophies to Fascism and show how the two are similar, it does not make Fascism valid.

The first and most glaringly obvious problem with this piece of propaganda is the fact that we have not had a budget in 5 years.  How in the hell can they, with a straight-face, declare a reduction in the budget deficit when there is no budget to base it upon?  Here is an immediate solution:  declare a budget of $100 trillion - boom, now you can declare a "budget surplus" at the same time that your federal debt is growing exponentially!!!

The problem is:  most people have no idea and will swallow pieces like this without a second thought.
-----==----==---==-----
Wake me up when you can say we have "The Incredible Shrinking National Debt."

You're not confusing the issue at all. The system your friend suggests for everyone paying in for a basic service of health care is a single payer type of system commonly used in socialist societies. The police forces and military are central to the protection of the nation, not necessarily the individual. As a matter of fact a recent court ruling said that the police have zero responsibility to protect individuals. Their responsibility is to mitigate the situation and end a threat to the community as a whole. Here's the kicker. By the constitution the Federal government has limited rule over what the citizens must do. The only true role of the Fed should be to manage the states collectively and make decisions that affect the country as a whole. States have their domain, counties, local etc... The problem is that under a truly free society as defined by the Constitution the Federal government cannot require a citizen to purchase anything. If they wanted to and could get the votes to have a basic health care service paid for from the taxes we already currently pay in, then they could do that, but the premise of the ACA as it stands is unconstitutional as the Fed is levying a fine (call it what you want it's a fine) for not purchasing a product or service. This goes against everything that U.S. has been built upon. It infringes on personal freedoms and destroys a capitalist market in our society.
-----==----==---==-----
I think you are trying to discuss things known as public goods.  A big component regarding whether something is a public good is the ability to exclude non-participants.  

If someone doesn't want to pay for health care, it would be fairly easy  for health care providers to deny them that service.

If somone doesn't want to pay for defense, it would be virtually impossible to exclude them from national defense.  You can't prevent an invasion for some housesolds and not others.

There is a much stronger argument that defense is a public good that should be provided by the government requring taxes than health care, which private individuals and organizations can more easily ensure compliance by charging fees for service.
-----==----==---==-----
The military is identical to universal health care. These are both welfare systems.

The government, under the threat of force, collects taxes to fund both. The taxes are taken from you to fund a progam that you have no say in, a program you are not able to opt out of, to create government employment. Your wealth is redistributed to other individuals selected by the governmnet.

The only difference is some people are willing to say, "Well, I support the government using force against everyone to collect taxes for *X*, but not for *Y*."

On a side note, from a utility perspective health care would actually be *more* important. There is zero doubt that health care is more important in the context of preserving and saving lives than a military force.

I just read some of the comments on this thread and it about made my head explode. I mean honestly, I can't even debate these people. They don't know what they're talking about. How can you really discuss this issue with someone using the phrase "30 clip magazines?" 

Aside, even when I point out that "scary" assault rifles are only responsible for a **fraction** of the 1% of *crimes involving rifles,* they just don't comprehend it. This "movement," these ads, etc, are based on fear, ignorance, and are being used by fascist, leftist authoritarians to manipulate low information voters. 

It makes me sick.

None of the things they sold as being banned are banned outside of schools. Last time I checked, ARs were banned in schools.

On another note, why do you care so much about whether or not climate change is manmade?  Just because we didn't cause it doesn't mean we can't fix it.  Unless of course you subscribe to the theory of the rapture or some other such delusion, as I'm sure most of you dumb kids do.

I find 97% consensus on anything is bunk. You'll have more than 3% not willing to admit the sky is blue.

Climate change is one of those more nebulous issues. There SEEMS to be climate change but the scientific community really has not idea whether it is man made or global-cyclic and with their own admission (at least the admission of the non-statist pure scientists), their models are pretty Fisher Price when compared to reality.

Even if there is some truth to climate change, the government is working this over like Vince with the Slap Chop.

I was thinking of something the other day.   With "Universal Healthcare" we would be dealing directly with our doctors, with no middleman.   They at least have to take the Hippocratic Oath (whether they honor it or not I cannot say).   Yet, we get "Universal Healthcare Insurance" which puts a middleman between us and the doctors.   The middleman gets to decide what they are willing to cover in terms of treatments.  The middleman is a corporation.  The share holders of said corporations typically only care that their dividends increase (ROI).   Worse yet.   They certainly do not have to take the Hippocratic Oath.   If they did it likely would not be honored anyway.   The joke of calling this "Universal Healthcare" is on US (the victims of the law).

Republicans for the most part failed to hold Bush accountable for his violations of our Constitutional rights, and even elected him to a second term.

Democrats for the most part failed to hold Obama accountable for his violations of our Constitutional rights, and even elected him to a second term.

I don't see how this can possibly end well for those of us who would just like to have the protections from the government afforded to us by the Constitution .
-----==----==---==-----
It really is a lot more serious than most people have recognized. Liberals should be just as concerned as libertarians and conservatives.

Barring some kind of radical action by either Congress or the Supreme Court, it's fairly safe to assume that the next time a Republican wins the presidential election, he will use executive orders to indefinitely delay some or all of Obamacare, at a minimum, and possibly many other major pieces of legislation, too. There is no logical reason why a Republican president would have to enforce Medicare or Medicaid any more than Obama himself has been enforcing Obamacare.

The Constitution orders the president to "faithfully execute" the laws passed by Congress. [President Obama has made it clear he doesn't care --- at all --- what Congress does.](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/01/28/obama-vows-to-act-on-economy-without-legislation/) He has violated the plain language of Obamacare on multiple occasions. If no one stands up now, the precedent will be set for all future presidents to pick and choose which laws, if any, they will enforce.
-----==----==---==-----
This is not about Party affiliation.   It is about KNOWINGLY violating the law.  Repeatedly.   For political gain.

It's like when a player on your sports team does something horrible he's only a misunderstood scamp but if someone from someone else's sports team does it he's an absolute scumbag.

-----==----==---==-----
I completely disagree.  Obama is not the fucking problem here.  He is a symptom.  Obama is just continuing the policies of Bush who was continuing the policies of Clinton who was continuing the policies of Bush who was continuing the policies of Reagan who was......  you get the idea.

The problem is deep seated stupidity and laziness on the part of the American Sheep.  They want to be taken care of so they vote for Santa Claus.

Quit blaming one guy for the profound problems this country has, wont fix and will allow to get worse until it collapses.

Edit: changed seeded to seated.
-----==----==---==-----
Obama was held back his first term by a congress who wouldn't work with him and it was to risky for him to go against them for fear of not winning reelection.  He will have nothing to lose when he gets reelected and will revert all his past policies and actions and make up for it!

Just kidding,  political fandom leaves to many people optimistic about their political team being able to solve issues,  when in reality both political teams are playing the same ball game just with different strategies on how to gain power and control.

&gt;“It is simply untrue that we’re living in very different or unprecedented times. The framers lived in these times,”

I can get behind a lot of what he's saying, but not this. The framers may have disagreed on certain points and name called to the extreme, but today is so much different from back then it's ridiculous. Not even taking into account technological advances that make certain parallels impossible, [this congress is](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/07/13/13-reasons-why-this-is-the-worst-congress-ever/)

I'm sorry to be 'that gal' but is there anyone who would be kind enough to give me a brief run-down of how Obama has been expanding executive power?

I am *not* trying to be argumentative or challenging. It's just, I have been purposefully burying my head in the sand when it comes to politics for basically my whole adult life up until this point because it seemed too messy. But recently I found this sub through following a certain user who had well-thought-out comments. The 'straight-up' philosophy that seems to be represented here is intriguing to me, and now I am motivated to learn more and start discussing these issues with people.

Barry's blatant flouting of his legal obligations and congress's unwillingness to hold him to account aside...

Does anyone else notice how effectively this ratchets the Overton window *even further* leftward? 

Here's a highly-regarded admitted liberal academic speaking out against the administration's actions. It's way too easy to now spin him (and his opinions) as somehow to the right of "reasonable." The OFA cultists will do just that, and their voices are several factors louder than the RWNJs(tm) that might balance them out.

As invalid and perverted our 2-dimensional right/left political spectrum is in relation to reality, there's enough people that find it a useful template and will continue to view and define these issues through that lens. 

If I was a tinfoil hat type I wouldn't rule this whole gambit out as a clever bit of gaming.

The government can do whatever the fuck it wants for "Safety" and "the common good"

The Government can suspend freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to own guns, freedom to have a fair and speedy trial, freedom from self incrimination etc etc *as long as* the government makes the argument that suspending freedoms is for "Safety" and "The Common Good."

This Pandoras box has been opened.  It cant be shut now.  We have allowed the government to rule us instead of serve us and now we are its slaves.

So the ban was upheld.What real result was accomplished?Yes those celebrating Cinco De Mayo at the school will no longer be insulted if that was the intention-which is good.But it is sad that all this in the end will do nothing to change whatever tensions exist.The school may have prevented an altercation on that day-but I feel making it an issue only escalates the problem.Seems that the school should handle this situation within their student body in a much different way.No wonder relations are poor if this is an educators idea of a fix.This is not a problem only in this country or between these two ehnic groups-I give Northern Ireland as an example.
-----==----==---==-----
Cinco de Mayo isn't celebrated in Mexico, except for the city of Pueblo.
Cinco de Mayo is a beer advertisement in the US.

The French were trying to create a strong hold in mexico and would have gone on to break the US Union by assisting the South had things gone better for the French.

A student should be allowed to stir up controversy by wearing a shirt. Freedom of speech right?
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;The court said schools have wide latitude in curbing certain civil rights to ensure campus safety.

Guys, don't you see?  This isn't so bad, they're cutting down on civil rights to keep our kids safe.  So they can LEARN in a safe environment.  Kids aren't really people, anyways.  I wish people would stop twisting these things around to make it look like big brother is after you.  Even when it doesn't work out for them, they're trying their hardest, and I have a lot of respect for that.


-----==----==---==-----
&gt;Our role is not to second-guess the decision to have a Cinco de Mayo celebration

But they second-guessed students wearing shirts with flags on it?  And apparently, despite forcing the students to alter their shirts, there were numerous racial conflicts that day.  It seems if they were truly concerned about the "safety of the students" they should just stop making special celebrations for a foreign holiday.  In fact, just remove all holiday "events" and stick with just educating kids.
-----==----==---==-----
So does this mean that Mexican flags cannot be worn during 4th of July?
-----==----==---==-----
Doesn't say they can't wear French flag shirts. But seriously, Cinco de Mayo isn't even celebrated that much by the Mexicans. The school's having an irrational fear.
-----==----==---==-----
They should ban Cinco de Mayo celebrations.  Problem solved.
-----==----==---==-----
I wonder if they consider themselves cowards.
-----==----==---==-----
Did they take the flags down in the classrooms and skip doing the pledge that day as well? Do they even still do that?
-----==----==---==-----
This sounds like a good way to make children who are already slightly racist *even more* racist. They wanted to wear American flag shirts to try and upset Mexicans; now the government says they can't wear American flag shirts. 

I am sure that will make them much more open to Mexicans now. /s
-----==----==---==-----
Won't somebody think of the children?
-----==----==---==-----
&gt; The unanimous three-judge panel said **past problems** gave school officials sufficient and justifiable reasons for their actions. 

Emphasis mine. 

Before we start circlejerking too hard, that is a very important phrase. It means the officials need a historical reason for banning the shirts. 

Is it still stupid, sure. But the majority of people in here are acting like the Obama administration made a unilateral federal law banning flag shirts. 
-----==----==---==-----
May 5th? Sounds like senior skip day to me.
-----==----==---==-----
Sounds like the kids wearing the American flag shirts were just being little shits and trying to stir up trouble.

 Without an over abundance of fat holier than thou self righteous police, there wouldn't be a police state, you see. They (the politicians) need the bodies to have any sort of success at what they're doing, and the people who willingly get trained, willingly sign their employee contracts, and willingly enforce the tyranny of the legislators are just as important and hence just as responsible. 

  It's like saying the hit man isn't the problem because he has a family. I don't know if anyone is aware, BUT EVERYONE HAS A FAMILY AND PEOPLE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR, it's an excuse that bad people use to justify their bad actions. The people who rounded up and killed the Jews at the direction of the Nazi politicians were just following orders so they could feed their families too. And obviously Hitler wouldn't have been able to do it himself, so yeah they're responsible. 

 If ignorance of the law is no excuse for me, then ignorance of my rights is no excuse for the people who take the jobs and accept the pay to violate our rights. I might, though give some leeway to your ridiculously huge fallacy that the people who enforce tyranny aren't responsible for tyranny, if there were stories of cops anywhere that didn't issue traffic tickets, or enforce drug laws, but strictly investigate actual crime with actual victims. (I understand that in high population areas the cops are classified under a specific department like homocide, but those guys get assigned to whatever the boss says) Where are the cops who stand up against the legislators when they pass bad laws? I mean of all the people who would know what a bad law is I think it would be the people who's  job is to enforce said law. Oh that's right they keep they're fucking mouths shut because their incomes are more important to them than the rights of the populace they "protect" and "serve".  

  And yes I truly believe the cops in my town want to ruin lives, or else they wouldn't arrest kids for a small amount of pot  and put them in the system, which everyone knows makes criminals out of punks and better criminals out of criminals. 


FUCK THE COPS AND ALL WHO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE PLIGHT OF THE OPRESSORS.

Most cops just want a decent job with good benefits and retirement. They wanna help people, do their time, and retire with a good pension. However, Too many cops sign up for the thrill of being able to bash and bully people with impunity. They go into it with the wrong attitude and act like having a badge gives them permission to do whatever they want to people. When that happens, it needs to be brought up. People need to see these psychos for what they really are.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm as law abiding as I can be, I obey traffic laws (I am that guy on the highway that drives the speed limit) I don't smoke pot, drink and drive, steal, or hurt people.  I try to give police the benefit of the doubt, and there has only been one time (back in college) that a police officer was not perfectly reasonable and polite with me, however, there are way too many instances of police doing the things, that, were I to copy their actions, I would be arrested and charged with a crime.  

I want the NAP to be law, but even before that, I want ALL laws to be applied equally to every citizen, regardless of the little piece of metal on their shirt, or the blue lights on their car.  

Until we are all innocent until proven guilty, safe from unreasonable search and seizure, safe from being deprived of life, liberty, or property by a corrupt government without due process of law, free to travel, and free from being sexually assaulted based on my decision to travel by air, or the testimony of a dog, until all that happens, fuck them and everything they stand for because if I'm responsible for my actions, so are they.  


-----==----==---==-----
 &gt; You must realize that police are simply doing their job

Oh if only that were true



From personal experience -and without going into detail - I experienced the police lying on a official police report, but my complaint was whitewashed with the police complaints office( a cop^surprise? ) both ignoring ( or failing to obtain) physical and witness evidence

So .... there are bad cops, but that in itself shouldn't be a problem if they investigated and disciplined/charged/held accountable/etx  with *at least* the same fervor and independence that they apply to 'civilians'

But when they dont? its not just trust in 'that cop' that fails, its the police system as a whole that fails in its duty and trust, - and in my case failed hard 

and that police system as a whole unfortunately includes the good cops ----    even if it  includes   post after post of cop bashing

So they feel upset and unfairly castigated by that?

There is an answer if they are brave enough to want to do something

*Physician, heal thyself*


-----==----==---==-----
No, police apologist.

It is not an excuse to say that police are "simply doing their job." This means that the job is bad and they are bad people for taking the job.

If they are enforcing laws that are wrong, they are just as responsible as the politicians who made those laws. In fact, in many ways they are *more* responsible. All it would take is for police officers to say, "No, I'm not enforcing this bad law," or "if this is made a law, I quit" to end most bad policies.

If you do not like a law and the law is immoral, wrong, oppressive, unconstitutional, etc. you do not have to follow the law. You don't have to beg permission from your rulers - *"pretty please, change this law Mr. Politician"* - to fix it. 

The state would like you to think this way, though. It ensures that no one protests, no one makes a scene, no one engages in civil disobedience, and everyone is very easy to control.

DNI James Clapper committed perjury on March 12, 2013 ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRhjgynfhag

18 U.S. Code Section 3282 stands for the proposition that the Attorney General can initiate charges up until March 12, 2018.

Inauguration Day is January 20, 2017.  Can we attempt to get a campaign promise of sorts from potential presidential candidates like Rand Paul to direct their Attorney General to go after James Clapper given the fact that President Obama is unwilling to direct Eric Holder to enforce the law?

An interesting discussion from a panel of Free Keene activists at last weekend's New Hampshire Liberty Forum. Focus is on outside the system activism.

Hell yes let it all go through.

Because the speed at which the public can get butthurt has completely changed.

Let's say a baker refuses to give Adam and Steve a cake for their wedding. Well Steve may have seen that coming and recorded the conversation, then puts it up on Youtube. 

That goes viral and now the local news wants to get a hold of the story. Because even though companies have the right to refuse, it doesn't mean we can't shame the shit out of them.

Soon enough, the baker and his reputation on Yelp, Urbanspoon, Angie's List, Foursquare and Google have caused his sales to go through the floor. And he goes out of business.

And the word of mouth from the lcoal news is even worse. He's now lost friends over it.

Society now has social tools that act as a disincentive for people and businesses to be assholes. The role of the government (in this case) has been replaced.
-----==----==---==-----
Would I like to live in a society where the right to private property and association is subject to the restriction that if you are a business open to public, you must not discriminate, or in a society where the right to private property and association are absolute?

Let me think: am I OK with forcing a baker to bake a cake for a black man, or am I OK with a black man being refused service just because he is black? I think it is wrong to force someone to bake, but I also think it is wrong to refuse someone because they are black. Hmm... but I think it is much more wrong to refuse someone because they are black than force a baker to bake a cake for a black man. Therefore, I find the public restriction on the right to private association quite reasonable.

I think this is how a lot of the people would think about the issue. Few people take the rights to be absolutes. They understand that the rights come with reasonable restrictions, and as a society and as individuals, we constantly negotiate about these restrictions. If your argument relies on an absolutist position about a particular right, you will have to rethink. 

Let me be clear and admit that there is nothing logically unsound about the libertarian argument. It is just that the axiom they start with does not seem to have much currency.
-----==----==---==-----
The true test of one's commitment to free association, like with free speech, isn't when they defend the freedom of someone to say or associate in ways they agree with, but when they defend the freedom of someone to say or associate in ways that they vehemently disagree with.
-----==----==---==-----
I can respect the position that *all* civil rights laws should be eliminated.  But I can't respect the position that says we should keep some of the existing civil rights protections while denying them to gay individuals.

Under current law, a gay baker cannot legally refuse service to an evangelical Christian, because religious discrimination is prohibited by law.  But many Christians nonetheless believe they should be entitled to legally discriminate against gay people.  That situation is unfair and untenable.
-----==----==---==-----
And, unfortunately, under the current interpretation of the Commerce Clause, they absolutely believe they have the power to.

If competing, untraceable, and thus untaxable currencies don't affect "interstate commerce," then nothing does.

Go for it. It can't hurt really. Libertarians try to work with Republican conservatives, so why not Democrats. It's a fine strategy that can create some discussion on issues. Whether it'll convince progressives is another story, but making them think and exposing it to them is not a bad idea.
-----==----==---==-----
I'd be happy for that. Unfortunately, progressives seem to be voting for pro war and anti civil liberties, though. They're all bark and no bite. 

-----==----==---==-----
I say the Libertarian Party, the Green Party, the Justice Party, the Peace &amp; Freedom Party, the Reform Party, and the Pirate Party should form one great coalition.

Unfortunately I think it is pretty much a non-starter. You can't really compartmentalize liberty. Not to say politicians can't build coalitions (like Rand Paul has with Bernie Sanders on the NSA). Or that there aren't interesting organizations out there like the Alliance of Libertarians Left (praxeology.net/all-left.htm). 

But ultimately competing core philosophical beliefs make any lasting, effective alliance seem very unlikely to me.

1) Invoke terrifying and external enemy

2) Create laws to survey and 'search' and monitor all citizens 'for their safety.

3) *Use 2 party politics to blame the other for privacy violations and focus on petty issues (such as the exact tax rate or funding for a dept. and certain appointments for committees)

4) *Slowly pass laws among all states and the nation to take away freedoms here and there (bearing arms, curfews, certain materials) for the purpose of keeping the peace.

5) Silence/harass "activist groups" as anti-"nation" and belittle them and those that join publicaly, while pressuring thm internally to shut down watchdog groups etc.

6) Influence Press to continue reporting pro gov issues, or to ignore government issues altogether by filling time with feel good stories or accidents, etc.

7) sway primary elections to make sure pro-statist members get more funding (and therefore win)

8) Start having "gun buybacks" and small scale gun confiscations (via forms) to make sure people are 'safe.'

9) confiscate the small proportion that still has weapons, name them anti-nation and/or crazy.

10) Burn Constitution/Bill of rights.

TL;DR If you take away firearms, the homicide rate goes up but the firearm homicide rate goes down so you are safer because you are being killed by something other than firearms.
-----==----==---==-----
Here's a direct link to the study.  

http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full#ref-30

Some people in this sub would like to tell you that you will be more "safe" if you have a gun in your house.  However, the facts say that is bullshit.

I'm not against people having the right to own guns, but I feel like people should realize that gun ownership is not something that statistically makes you "safer."  Glorifying gun ownership is not a good thing for society.
-----==----==---==-----
First thing I noticed is that they didn't bother quoting specifically HOW MUCH more dangerous a gun makes your home. No mention of how much more likely a household with a gun in it is more likely have death or injury occur than one without.

Second I notice, and probably even worse, is that it seems to focus centrally on deaths and injuries from *guns* alone. The problem is that this is pretty dishonest. Just because having a gun in the home makes you more likely to die from a gun-related accident (just as having a car makes you more likely to die from a car-accident), it doesn't necessarily you're more likely to die, period. Simply put, there's no real way to know that a person who died from a gunshot wouldn't have died from slipping in the shower a week later. You can only die once, so when one thing kills you, it precludes you from being killed by some other thing. So why focus on gun deaths and injuries alone?


Third, the study you linked to uses data from 1993. Which, if you look at the U.S. [homicide rate](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2013/05/SDT-2013-05-gun-crime-1-2.png) was literally a PEAK in terms of homicides. The current homicide rate is half that. So in *LITERAL TERMS,* we have gotten safer, even though gun ownership is about the same.

The suicide argument never really struck me as convincing. The U.S. is on par with gun-free UK in terms of suicide rate, and is much lower than that of gun free S. Korea or Japan.

 Now, you REALLY want to slice into the 'safety' question? Control for single women. Not only do women use firearms to [protect themselves from sexual assault many times a year](http://www.guncite.com/gcdgklec.html), but anecdotally, there are regular stories of women protecting themselves from assailants, using firearms:

http://youtu.be/hGBEDCxmyzs

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7OfbvNmGJc

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiiQQP4-Ijw&amp;feature=player_embedded

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CriVUV5lh_M

http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Homeowner-Shoots-Intruders-Police-174633151.html

http://www.click2houston.com/news/Home-invasion-suspect-arrested-after-woman-opens-fire/-/1735978/18331728/-/format/rss_2.0/-/s329rz/-/index.html

And the occasional terrifying reminder of what can happen when a woman CAN'T defend herself:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU0EJS3cJIc

Add to that that women are MUCH less likely to commit or be victimized by homicide of any type, that women have a [much lower suicide rate,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide) and generally are much less violent (in the aggregate), I think you can make a pretty good case that a woman with a gun is much safer than a woman without one. Which, if true, would make the point that some people are, in fact, safer with a gun, and making blanket statements that "guns do not make people safer" is not true for all 'people.' Some people will be made safer, some people will be made less safe, the key is to finding out who is safer and who isn't.

In fact, I'll bet (though I have no data for this) that a woman having a gun in the home is safer than a woman having a man in the house, all else being equal, simply because the man is more likely to hurt her than the gun.

 So perhaps the real variable that determines how 'safe' you are with a gun isn't the gun itself, but rather the presence or absence of violent assholes, most of whom happen to be male (again, in the aggregate, this is not a judgment of every male). So if you ask me, the question that should be looked at is whether a person with a gun is more or less likely to be attacked by a violent asshole, and how that chance of being attacked by a violent asshole compares to the likelihood of being hurt by the gun itself.

End point being, that however you want to judge 'safety' compared with gun ownership, you will have a hard time convincing me that *I,* individually, will be made safer if I make myself more helpless.

-----==----==---==-----

[This video](http://youtu.be/DvxT7fryE3Q#aid=P-NhfrEU0Pg), by Learn Liberty at the Institute for Humane Studies, is the best and most concise explanation of the dominant libertarian position on the FDA and government regulatory systems.

The important thing to realise is that libertarians are not against regulation in its own right.  We are only opposed to *government* regulation, and even then only most of it.  We are in favour of *voluntary* regulation wherever possible, such as the voluntary regulatory organisations which govern product quality and safety in things like home appliances, electronics, construction materials, and even things like bullet proof vests, as described in the video.  In fact, the vast majority of products in the western world that are regulated, are regulated by private entities in a voluntary manner.  In exchange for the rights to place a stamp on a product package, producers of goods will pay money to organisations that specialise in the certification and regulation of those products, and market competition produces low costs, minimal red tape, and maximum safety.

For an example you might recognise, have you ever seen [this symbol](http://www-tc.pbs.org/opb/meaningoffood/food_and_culture/kosher_symbols/pix/ou.gif) stamped in the corner of the nutrition information space on food wrappers?  That certifies that the product is kosher, and because displaying the symbol on packaging attracts more Jewish customers, companies have an incentive to pay one of the private Jewish organisations responsible for the certification of kosher foods in order to gain the rights to use the symbol.

**Edit: I see another commenter has linked the same video as well.  It is truly the best brief summary of the topic.  I recommend it.**
-----==----==---==-----
Consider the following: Imagine the FDA approved a drug tomorrow. They had it in testing for 9 years. The drug is expected to save 10,000 lives a year from whatever disease it treats. Didn't the FDA just admit to killing 90,000 people?

When a drug harms someone, you hear about it immediately - news is all over it. But when thousands of people a year die because the drugs that exist to treat them are illegal to purchase due to the FDA, there's no coverage. If you were dying of cancer with months to live, and there was a drug to help you, wouldn't YOU rather be the one to decide how much risk you were willing to take? 

Most of the FDA's testing isn't for safety - most of the drugs already exist in other countries and are known to be fine. Instead, they test for efficacy, so they know exactly HOW effective they are. Since they're the only ones on the USA authorized to do this (and they don't accept what other countries say about those drugs), their backlog is incredible, taking years or even DECADES to approve drugs, during which time people are suffering or dying because they can't access a perfectly usable drug.

It's a matter of hidden costs versus visible gains. The FDA could still act as an advisory board, and they could also open up the task to private enterprises instead of maintaining a monopoly, both of which would help immensely. But the situation now is that people use the scary-sounding possibility of dozens or even hundreds taking an unsafe drug to justify an organization that costs tens of thousands of lives each year.
-----==----==---==-----
Human beings should be allowed to put whatever they want into their bodies.  End of proof.

The FDA should rate, test and evaluate drugs.  Then they should make their findings available to the people so that consumers can be informed.  Then they should get the fuck out of my way and let my buy what I want.
-----==----==---==-----
Government control of an industry is not "regulation."

-----==----==---==-----
You're implying that if it weren't for the FDA, modern medicine would descend into some sort of "Island of Dr. Moreau-meets-Josef Mengele" scenario.  

Your "question" is nothing more than a twist on the old canard that if a Libertarian is elected to office, the first thing they'll do is start jackhammering the roads and closing fire departments.
-----==----==---==-----
the FDA wont allow terminal patients receive experimental testing and they die as these treatments go through often a decade of testing to be approved.

as john stossel discussed on his show, there were newspaper articles one day about a new treatment that was approved and the headlines all stated "X number of people to be saved annually by new drug!" and stossel correctly pointed out, "y number of people have been dying for the last 10 years because they weren't allowed to receive the treatment experimentally"
-----==----==---==-----
The FDA has a government enforced monopoly on food and pharmaceutical regulation. A competitive market for regulatory bodies would be much better for consumers for all the same reasons that competition is better than a monopoly in every other market.

Obviously these companies wouldn't be "regulatory agencies" in the traditional sense because they wouldn't be able to use force to prevent consumers from having access to certain drugs and food, instead, pharmaceutical companies would seek out testing from these independent private companies for their golden seals of approval.  These drug-testing companies have an incentive to protect consumers to protect their own reputation, and the drug companies have an incentive to have their drugs tested by them to gain their seals of approval. 

The free market is always better than the government.

Hope that answer helped!

You should watch "Dallas Buyers Club".. The whole movie is about a guy having to break the law to get effective AIDS drugs to patients that needed them.

By being a federal agency, the FDA is inherently subject more to politics than science on what actually is an "effective" drug.  

Even worse, the FDA uses force to prevent certain drugs from going to patients that need them.

Are you seriously asking someone to prove their opinion?

There are pros and cons to having an FDA.  Not having one is a matter of opinion.  I can prove to you that I have an opinion, but its impossible to prove an opinion.
-----==----==---==-----
So there is 2 aspects of drug testing. 1) that the drug is safe and 2) that the drug works.
I don't believe the drugs I take are safe because the government says so. I believe they are safe because otherwise the company producing the drug would get sued.
Proof the drugs work according to the FDA's standards is not needed. The proof of this is off label uses of current drugs. I asked someone why drugs don't have to go through FDA trials again to prescribe it for something other than what it was originally cleared for. It is a double standard.
-----==----==---==-----
Because the FDA is an extension of Monsanto, the FDA works with the Dept of Agriculture to promote their ridiculous Food Pyramid (which at one time encouraged people to eat between 6 and 11 helpings of bread, cereal, rice and pasta), and by delaying the release of lifesaving medicine, the FDA creates needless deaths.   
Private enterprise could do the job much better.  Check out the Kosher foods labeling system.  Underwriters Laboratories.  The Better Homes and Gardens seal of approval.  
And, when time permits, go see the film "Dallas Buyers Club".  
You'll laugh at the FDA afterwards.  
Hope this helps, and we appreciate the question.  
-----==----==---==-----
I think if the FDA did not exist, then things like INPO, Institute of Nuclear power operations, would be a lot more common. Essentially, the Nuclear utilities after three mile island got together and said, "Listen guys, people's faith in us are nil. If we want to keep operating we've got to up our safety and quality." 

Thus, INPO was born. An industry appointed self regulatory body. They have access to the american fleet of nuclear plants and they have the power to come in and shut down a nuclear plant that they deem unsatisfactory. They do inspections, recommendations, interface with government bodies. 

Now, there is nothing stopping other industries from doing the same thing. 

Beef producers? "Hey, its in our best interest to regulate each other, because if one of us poisons people, then they'll stop buying the product all together."

and the list continues.

I have been purchasing surplus vehicles from the government for years.  I repurpose them for farm use.  This latest batch of surplus vehicles, including humvees, has been deemed dangerous for public sale.  I suspect that the defense department is correct in this assumption.  With the troop draw downs from the middle east the government now has a huge surplus of nearly new tactical vehicles. 
They can't sell them and they can't store them for any extended period of time.  Giving vehicles to police departments take them off the federal governments books without scrapping an unused truck.  If these trucks were going straight to the scrap yard there would be people screaming their heads off about government waste.
I don't think police departments should have these vehicles and I doubt they can afford to maintain them.  That said, when you are a cop and someone offers you a half million dollar armored vehicle for free, you shut up and take it.
-----==----==---==-----
Many are. I've said it myself, although I would admit it is not a fair characterization of libertarians or libertarianism. I think libertarians tend to be very diverse.

A few major issues:

1. Libertarians who remain social conservatives. They reject social liberty and only embrace economic liberty. For example, supporting laws against "illegal immigration" because it is bad for "the economy" or "the taxpayers." No regard to the way this hurts the liberty of the immigrant. Also, libertarians who use libertarianism as an excuse to justify their own prejudices, racism, homophobia, etc. *"But I should have the liberty to be as racist as I want."*
2. Libertarians who do not follow the premises of libertarianism to their natural conclusion. *"Marijuana should be legal, but heroin is far too dangerous. Clearly we need the police to protect us from heroin."*
3. Libertarians who support forms of government employment, despite government employment being a form of welfare. This is especially evident in the context of the military.
4. Libertarians who support laws for victimless crimes. Ah, so you want to take my taxes and use force against me to push a special agenda you have or because it makes you feel extra safe?
5. Libertarians who support corporate industry and corporatism. Corporations are fundamentally a function of the state - the very existence of a "corporation" is due to the fact that governments invented a legal status known as a "corporation."
6. A tendency toward punitive justice that extends far beyond defense of the NAP. If you want to keep criminals from voting, sharing equal rights with other citizens, or punish them beyond what is necessary for restorative justice.
-----==----==---==-----
Libertarians aren't big social conservatives or interventionists when it comes to foreign policy. Most Republicans are. It's that simple. 
-----==----==---==-----
By being a libertarian in principle, and advocating for those principles.

I came to libertarianism disgusted by both parties with no strong leanings either way. People are going to have their misconceptions when they base their world views on a political spectrum: That one of two major political groups must be chosen over another, that one is necessarily correct. It's something that needs to be dispelled.

Sen. Leon obviously doesn't know what he's talking about. However, fictitiously embellishing to narrate a position is going both ways with this vid.


edit/clarification: I'm a gun guy, that weapon looked like it was built on an ar-15 style armature, which would typically be 22 cal. (specifically .223/5.56 nato), though it can also easily be obtained in .308 rem. this usually isn't the case. Sen. Leon definitely embellished the fire rate as well. This doesn't justify the obfuscation of the word "clip". In the video Sen. Leon was using the term clip as slang for a magazine, not multiple magazines, furthermore the image shown in the video for a clip was a "stripper clip" as shown here-http://www.thegunzone.com/stripper-clip.html. A stripper clip holds individual rounds in a row and has nothing to do with multiple magazines. Sen. Leon was devoid of factual information and so was the video.

Very limited government with societal rules is very different from all out anarchy free for alls.
-----==----==---==-----
Libertarianism is just the set of people who hold liberty as the highest political value, broadly speaking.

Anarchists are the ones who believe that a government is not needed to preserve liberty and in fact is anti-thetical to liberty. They would be subset of libertarians.

There are several flavors of anarchists, from the left wing brand at /r/anarchism to the propertarians at /r/anarcho_capitalism

 So how is it 'different?' You can be a libertarian and not be an anarchist. 

As to the broader question about anarchy, that's for another time.

Libertarianism is about small and constitutionally limited government, not no government.

&gt; Researchers concluded that ten people on the list do not even hold a Ph.D. in economics. One of them appears to be an undergraduate at Queens College who, according to his LinkedIn account, is seeking employment as a security guard.

&gt; There were 21 people on the list whose specialty and academic credentials couldn’t be determined by the Employment Policies Institute.

&gt; Researchers also report at least 40 signatories held radical political views or have made extreme statements, according to the Employment Policies Institute.

&gt; One of the list’s members defined a rogue state as “a fierce and dangerous animal, like an elephant, that separates itself from its herd,” and labeled the United States “the world’s number one rogue.” Another called former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez “a great leader.” A third wrote a paper in which he praised the “particular model of socialism pioneered by the Soviet Union.”

&gt; Another signer, Paul Zarembka, edited the book,“The Hidden History of 9/11.”

I don't feel that there's any moral difference between killing with a gun vs killing with a drone. I just don't want my corrupt police protectors to have another tool to abuse.

Isn't there a deeper, more interesting point here, that while asking the question may make something that was previously unthinkable and unquestionably rejected, something that is at least partially more acceptable, the notion that ideas can be controlled by not asking questions seems inherently anti-libertarian in nature.  Wouldn't the libertarian position be to allow the question to be asked, to have the debate, and then win it, rather than to have ideas, even ideas that you might thoroughly support, as sacred cows.  

It's also perfectly possible, after all, that having those debates over more extreme infractions may lead people to consider and establish principles regarding government surveillance that affect their views in other cases.

I remember not too long ago drones were really controversial, but it was promised that they would never be used on US citizens.

Napolitano is misguided.  The quote of Bill McMorris' title is ABSOLUTELY absurd. 

“Conservatives Will Embrace Libertarians When Libertarians Stop Embracing Government.” 

This from a movement that rejects Kennedy's decision in Lawrence and therefore wishes to return to anti-sodomy laws.  Conservatives support big government on this issue and most others.  I don't see any reason to pine for their embrace.

Napolitano then accepts McMorris' strawman characterization of Tuccille uncritically and tries to purge Tuccille by appealing to the authority of the Pauls to speak for the liberty movement.  

Further, Arizona did not tailor this law to wedding photographers.  It absolutely would apply to restaurants.  It grants a special right to the religious, asks the state to determine the sincerity of their belief and is intended to single out one group.  There is no reason any libertarian should support it.

-----==----==---==-----
She has political adversaries.  And anything she says will be used to circumstantiate her wrongdoing even if she did nothing criminal.  
-----==----==---==-----
So she can take the fall and say it was all her fault.  Then the IRS can go back to business as usual saying that all this messy business is in the past.

[Here's](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1258&amp;context=historical) a fairly lengthy memo detailing the facts of the case (which Reuters does to some extent, but which hasn't stopped everybody from acting as if this is some sort of proactive censorship). It isn't a hate speech case, except inasmuch as the plaintiff felt that she had been taken advantage of for a film whose content she didn't agree with and asserts an independent copyright to her performance, whether or not that's justified.

Considering how much anti-whatever group material there is on YouTube, it's likely that if her performance were removed the clip could return to YouTube. Again, it isn't a hate speech issue; it was a specific case introduced by a performer in the film. Right wing blogs will go nuts misrepresenting this case and talking about "Shariah law," but let's be better than that.
-----==----==---==-----
If she was paid for her performance, am I correct in believing that she is not entitled to the copyright?

Awful, terrible, sensationalist headline. I understand that's what this blog has as the headline, but that's not a valid excuse.

Not surprisingly, this "article" does a poor job presenting facts.

It is based on personal freedom over yourself.  As individuals we should have complete freedom to live our lives however we want to, so long as we do not harm others. My sexual preferences, drug habits, eating habits, are my business and no one else. Our country has a duty to protect itself, but not to interfere in the business of other countries. The US Constitution was written based on the values of liberty and personal responsibility.  The principles of free enterprise are at the core as well. No one should be picking winners and losers in society. The individual has choices. There is so much more I could say.....  
-----==----==---==-----
First of all, you have understand that libertarianism is a PHILOSOPHY, not just a political party, not a party platform of political positions and collected special interest desires, and its not a specific form of government.   

There are no such things as "libertarians are pro-x or anti-y", but if you are a libertarian you are armed with a strong and amazing philosophy that will guide you to coming to your own conclusions about what is the right thing to do is according to your own personal beliefs as an individual.  The idea here is that you use this philosophy to help guide decisions and guide the application of government, not tell you that you must believe x.  

It sort of seems that the main problem that many people have with libertarianism is that it requires YOU to actually think for yourself.  Being a Republican or Democrat is easy...you just cheer for team red or team blue, and whatever that team says or does is good, and you boo against the other side and whatever they say or do must be bad, that is simple.  Libertarian does not provide that, its a little harder, and I wonder if that is a good part of why it does not appeal to the masses very much.  


But to get started, there are really only a handful of key concepts that will help things start to make sense.

The main one really is the Non-Aggression-Principle.  Learn about that and you will start to get a clue where libertarian is coming from.

There are some other concepts with natural rights, what is property, the idea that the state can only do the same functions as an individual can do, etc..  but that can come later.

Also, remember libertarian does not equal no government.  Most Libertarians believe there is a legitimate function of government for the protection of the people and their property, which can include a defense force, a judicial and criminal/police system.  Lots of libertarians believe that early america (minus the slavery thing which was as much social as governmental), is fairly close to what a  libertarian minarchist government would look like.  I can see where that thinking comes from because libertarianism is a decedent of what was called classical liberalism during the 1700-1900s in England, France and the rest Europe and included figures such as John Locke, Adam Smith, .   It's not secret that much of that classical liberalism is what the US founders were very much coming from and were influenced by, so american libertarians have a little bit of a tie to the american founders in thinking. 

-----==----==---==-----
Do whatever you want as long as you don't fuck with someone else.

-----==----==---==-----
If you want to understand the moral compass of most libertarians, you just need to ask yourself one question: do ends justify the means? 

To a pure libertarian, there are no ends, only means. 

So it doesn't matter how much good a government program does if it needs to be funded through the coercion of taxation. To a libertarian, you can't violate the rights of one person to make ten better off. 
-----==----==---==-----
There are quite few schools of thought and different opinions regarding economics, but I think most libertarians agree on the one core principle: liberty.  

Libertarianism isn't unified into one school of thought so you will find beliefs on both ends of the spectrum. Everyone has their own opinions and such, but ultimately it is just about allowing adults to choose what they do without restriction or hassle provided they do not infringe upon the rights and liberties of others.  It is your choice to put into your body what you want, regardless of those who feel they are in the moral majority to lock you up and imprison you under the threat of violence; all because you are in possession of a plant or substance they have deemed illegal.  It is the right to protect yourself and your property.  It is the right to live your life as you see fit without being coerced or threatened into propping up and supporting the status quo.  It is the ability to assert control and ownership over yourself.  It is about voluntary association amongst free individuals.  Personal liberty and responsibility are the ultimate end goals.
-----==----==---==-----
I'm not at all trying to pin a label on you, but it sounds like you are questioning the principles and the foundation on which you were taught. This is not at all a bad thing (and I am not at all saying you should ditch anything), if you don't fully understand what you "think" you believe, then what exactly do you believe? The introductory package stickied at the top of /r/libertarian is chock full of good material, I would highly recommend perusing it at your leisure (I would link it but I'm on a phone). I personally believe in the historical realities of Judeo-Christian teachings and understand them to promote individual responsibility, which I also see in libertarian ideals. I do not see these teachings as a promotion of social-conservatism or any other form of " nanny-state" social governance (socialism/others). Having said that, to say questioning is good, I'll also warn that to question for purely selfish motivations rarely accomplishes truly profound introspection. Many many many people have justified horrific actions through selfish motivations.
-----==----==---==-----
Without getting too philosophical, a nice start is the NAP.

Non-Aggression Principle.

It's morally wrong to initiate aggression against other peaceful human beings.
-----==----==---==-----
Basically 'do not initiate aggression of any kind on any other' ... and 'no ends ever justify means of force'.

This can then extend to a plethora of things, remarkably well, notably the immorality of taxation, pre-emptive war, and drug laws.

So much legislation today is *entirely* rooted in trying to reach ends by *any* means.
-----==----==---==-----
If I had to summarize libertarianism in one sentence, then it would be: Do not do to others what you do not want done to you.

For example, if you do not want liberals or atheists using government to force their values on you, then do not use government to force your values on them.  The reason why is because how we treat others tends to be how others treat us.  Even Jesus avoided forcing himself onto people.  If someone didn't have faith in him, then he didn't heal them.  Simple.

This [secular explanation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muHg86Mys7I) of libertarianism finalized my decision to be libertarian.
-----==----==---==-----
Libertarians put a lot of emphasis on "coercion" and "consent". I think the [George Ought To Help](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGMQZEIXBMs) video is a pretty good primer.

When you try to determine if xyz is consensual or coercive, you start developing other ideas, like "free-association" and "self-ownership".  Take, for example, marijuana legalization. Both Progressives and Libertarians want to legalize it. But for different reasons, and those reasons are important. The Progressive wants to legalize it because it's fairly safe and could generate tax revenue. The Libertarian wants to legalize it because you own your body.

1) People own themselves.

2) They own themselves in the past (property), present (freedom), and future (life). 

3) The initiation of force to take someone's property, freedom, or life is wrong. 

4) It is acceptable to use force to defend one's self or another's self at their request.

-----==----==---==-----
Actually, I'm not sure this is wrongly decided. Remember, the SCOTUS shouldn't be making public policy decisions, only interpreting law. The issue is that the existing asset forfeiture laws are written such that being convicted of a crime is *not* a necessary precondition for freezing of assets.

There was not, as I understand it, a question of the Constitutionality of the asset forfeiture laws *themselves* presented to the Court. It looks to me that the way the law is written, the defendants are not entitled to access to that money... and the law itself wasn't challenged. The only question before the court was whether a defendant could *subsequent to Grand Jury indictment*, challenge the probable cause *with respect to asset seizure*. That's a pretty limited question.
-----==----==---==-----
They can't get to my Bitcoins.
-----==----==---==-----
Legislation is the only solution here.  The federal government could pass laws limiting civil asset forfeiture and it wouldn't matter what the Supreme Court said.
-----==----==---==-----
And people think libertarians advocate anarchy and chaos.

Well what the fuck, exactly, do we have now with constantly changing laws, people not knowing their rights because the rules of the game keep changing?

This country *IS* anarchy.  What new law will we have to live under tomorrow at the whim of unelected officials and tyrannical leaders?

&gt; Ron Paul: Feds shouldn't 'interfere' with [anything]
-----==----==---==-----
Someone correct me if I am wrong, but wouldn't federal oversight of bitcoin completely defeat the purpose of it?  I am unfamiliar with it, but it just seems to me to be a currency that people who don't trust the government's regulation of the dollar use.  
-----==----==---==-----
The really interesting thing about Bitcoin is that while the government can come down hard right now on the Bitcoin exchanges and make it virtually impossible for people to move fiat in and out of the market, if Bitcoin ever gains wide acceptance, exchanges will play a smaller role.  If more and more transactions start to operate exclusively in Bitcoin, and merchants find they can manage their supply lines exclusively in Bitcoin, governments will lose almost complete control over Bitcoin without taking draconian measures.  I'm not ruling those out, but they would be wildly unpopular at that point.
-----==----==---==-----
I wouldn't be surprised if the state was behind a MtGox BTC hack and theft resulting in their insolvency.  

-----==----==---==-----
Not that feds could do much to stop person-to-person transactions. It'd just make 3rd party money transferring businesses harder to run.
-----==----==---==-----
If I get taxed on my income, they should tax bitcoin as it is income as well.
-----==----==---==-----
Ron Swanson: "Do you know how many pounds of money you have?"

-----==----==---==-----
I agree, we should let it destroy itself. 

I get it, you guys support anything that says, "fuck the government." But the government has actual roles and duties. Legitimizing a currency is certainly one of them. They don't have the right to manipulate it, but they can physically produce the currency for the country to use. 
-----==----==---==-----
They really don't have much of a choice at this stage.  It's too late for governments to stop it.
-----==----==---==-----
How on earth can they restrict bitcoin? Isn't it completely anonymous?
-----==----==---==-----
I find it probable that the US government will either manipulate digital currencies for their own purpose (turn it into little better than the US dollar) or shut it down as a terrorist funding network under the guise of national security.
-----==----==---==-----
I think that bitcoin is a proper eye-catching performance art piece to get us to reevaluate the ways in which interest is cheating and why it's not sustainable.
-----==----==---==-----
Oh, don't worry.  Bitcoin will crash all on its own.  Again, and again, and again...
-----==----==---==-----
They're not interfering. They're deliberately destroying. Government wants everyone to know that they're owned, and to meekly accept it.
-----==----==---==-----
Except Ron, they already have been.

If bitcoin had a free exchange with American currency, that'd be no interference. 

Instead they've kept making it harder to transfer bitcoin, putting pressure on businesses who could handle the transactions and made it harder for others to do so. 

They don't care if you buy bitcoins, but you damn well better bet they'd make it hard for you to take those those bitcoins and make them into real money. 
-----==----==---==-----
Forget "shouldn't" - try "do not have a legal right to."
-----==----==---==-----
Someone should tell Ron Paul that the US government is already mining and stealing coins when they get the chance. 
-----==----==---==-----
Bitcoin doesn't need any help running itself into the ground. This is the culmination of a bad idea.
-----==----==---==-----
Ron Paul is an utter moron.

He sees hundreds of millions of dollars going up in a bonfire, and thinks it's just fine.

He sees another opportunity to wag his scrawny old ass at the American government &amp; call it illegitimate, and he jumps at the chance.  He's a fool whom nobody can reason with. 

For all those who idolize him, please snap out of it.  If he had power, he would lead us over a cliff like a herd of lemmings.   
-----==----==---==-----
It's easy stopped. All the Gov't has to do is buy up all the bitcoins and or screw with the market by selling at a wide array of prices rendering the market so unstable people won't invest.

EDIT: I'm not saying stop it I love bitcoins! I am invested in it! but no law will stop bitcoin, if they wanted to stop it they need to win by buying it out
-----==----==---==-----
I agree with him but I still wanna see BitCoin die. I love it for what it is but AMD cards pricing has doubled(tripled in some cases) and now I can't buy their parts.

Seat belts save lives.  But being forced to wear them is an insane arrangement.  If you aren't intelligent enough to just put the damn thing on, you should die in a car accident.  Fuck you.  I've been in several car accidents, rear ended each time... wore my seatbelt and so did they.  Everyone walked away.  My wife didn't... she's dead.  That shit happens.  The sign shouldn't say 'click it or ticket' it should say 'put your seatbelt on or you're a god damn idiot and you deserve to die.' 
-----==----==---==-----
The seat belt law and New York is a cute little story that the author failed to tell us and that if he did would especially drive the point home.




* I'm shooting from the hip here-



Back when the drinking age was 18 and the federal government was moving towards making it 21 NY decided that it didn't want to. The federal government **threatened** to withhold highway funding from them.




In a concession NY agreed to enforce a seat belt law in lieu of raising the drinking age. A couple of years later they folded and not only had to raise the drinking age but also had a seat belt law.




* I should dig up an unbiased account for you all but.....yeah, I'm just lazy.
-----==----==---==-----
I remember driving home from work once and the police had set up a seatbelt checkpoint right in front of a railroad crossing. They had a few police SUVs in the median approacing the crossing, with bright lights and flashing signs. About 30 feet after the tracks was a busy intersection with a stop light. Needless to say, this stretch of road was  a congested nightmare and already had several distractions and safety concerns. Now throw into the mix the setting sun, icy roads (it was during the winter) and the rush hour traffic, this seatbelt check is just adding to the distractions. I was blown away how they thought this was a good idea. All in the name of "safety".
-----==----==---==-----
No moving violations in 30  years here...just 6 seat-belt tickets...not a single one on the highway.  It's bullshit that I have to wear my seatbelt in a rural town where nobody goes over 30 mph. $95 a piece now.
-----==----==---==-----
You know that little flashing seatbelt guy in your car? He's a democrat. 
-----==----==---==-----
I remember the seat belt laws in 1984 and the uproar they caused.  The justification at the time was that the taxpayers would have to pay for emergency personnel to scrape you off the street if you didn't wear your seat-belt.  So what if you didn't want to wear one?  Didn't matter.  The greater good was what mattered.
-----==----==---==-----
My favorite is when anti seatbelt people die from not wearing seatbelts. Oh the irony.

I guess it's just DarWIN!!!!
-----==----==---==-----
I get everyone's about that "don't tell me how to live my life" life and tbh  I'm probably the last person to be saying anything about buckling up..

But how could anyone actually agree with this?

What happens if you're driving friends/family around and you get into an accident? YOU become a projectile and if you hit someone beside you with ur body/head, YOU are going to kill someone not ur car, not the asshole that hit you, so IMO you should be fined I don't need to know someone potentially could have lived if your body was strapped to your seat and not flying about the car smashing into everyone. People don't realize the consequences of their choices so unfortunate the police do.
-----==----==---==-----
Here's the thing about seat-belt laws. If the object was *truly* about the safety of individuals, then they'd also mandate that people wear helmets while driving.

In fact, if they were really serious about safety with no respect for other costs, they'd mandate that all cars come installed with roll-cages and 5-point safety belts. 

But they don't do that. Why not? Don't they care about public safety???

Probably because it would make cars way more expensive and price the poorest people right out of the market. But the apparently don't care as much if they hit poor people with a fine that may represent weeks of food or rent for that person.
-----==----==---==-----
Given that EMS can't just go 'lol this idiot didn't wear a seatbelt, let's leave him bleeding and dying and go back to the station' being forced to wear a seatbelt is a reasonable price to pay for their forced response.  Seatbelt laws are not there to protect you, they're there to make emergency services cheaper.

Lets just clarify, putting a limitation on an constitutional right is not getting rid of it. This has been justification for the voter I.D. laws. 
-----==----==---==-----
Let me throw this out there, and teach you some history that you probably didn't learn in government controlled public school.  

Until world war 1, private individuals in america owned fully armed with cannons and artillery WAR SHIPS.  In fact congress called on those people who help the country several times.

The same constitution is in effect today as was originally written with hardly any changes made, and the founding fathers who wrote it had no problem with private war ships when they wrote it, and that generation in fact even used the private war ships in the war of 1812 as did several generations of congresses and supreme courts after that.  

So, why was it perfectly fine and constitutional for 100 years, and suddenly it isn't?    The Constitution has not been re-written since then.


**HERE** is something you have to understand about the second amendment.  The entire purpose of the 2nd amendment was NOT for people to have hunting guns, or personal protection, or guns for sports shooting and target practice.  NONE of that is ever mentioned in the Constitution.  The SINGLE PURPOSE is stated in the first sentence.  Its in the Constitution for the people to be able to form a militia.  This is so the people will be armed and able to form their own non-government citizen army.    A militia is not a government army, a militia is all able bodied citizens and not under control of the government. 

And if you take that as its written, then in FACT the 2nd amendment actually gives the people the rights to bear any weapon currently needed to form their own ARMY.  So you actually have MORE of a right to any weapon used by the military including all fully automatic guns, machine guns, artillery, missiles etc... than you do a hunting shotgun which is not used by the military.

"Fired several shots, hit him once."  So much for training.  He just let her rip right there on the side of the road. Its a miracle that trigger happy pig didn't shoot someone else.

If people feel that police are an imminent threat to their life because they tend to shoot first and ask questions later, is it equally ok? Fucking asshole.
-----==----==---==-----
"Felt an imminent threat to his life". Yeah, the 70-year old man was going to instantly whip out a rifle, probably chamber it, take the safety off, take aim and then shoot in such a short time the officer would have NO time to react.

&gt;The officers with SWAT and dynamic-entry experience interviewed for this book say raids are orders of magnitude more intoxicating than anything else in police work. Ironically, many cops describe them with language usually used to describe the drugs the raids are conducted to confiscate. “Oh, it’s a huge rush,” Franklin says. “Those times when you do have to kick down a door, it’s just a big shot of adrenaline.” Downing agrees. “It’s a rush. And you have to be careful, because the raids themselves can be habit-forming.” Jamie Haase, a former special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement who went on multiple narcotics, money laundering, and human trafficking raids, says the thrill of the raid may factor into why narcotics cops just don’t consider less volatile means of serving search warrants. “The thing is, it’s so much safer to wait the suspect out,” he says. “Waiting people out is just so much better. You’ve done your investigation, so you know their routine. So you wait until the guy leaves, and you do a routine traffic stop and you arrest him. That’s the safest way to do it. But you have to understand that a lot of these cops are meatheads. They think this stuff is cool. And they get hooked on that jolt of energy they get during a raid.” - Radley Balko,  *Rise of the Warrior Cop*

As a Texan, the way some of us, and our politicians, follow their religions, is weird.

The extension of the Romeo and Juliet law (consenting partners both between 14-17 is legal) to homosexual couples went through pretty well, but once the word "marriage" gets thrown in, it becomes a whole new ball game in the Texas Congress.
-----==----==---==-----
Wouldn't it be nice if the Supreme Court just make marriage laws unconstitutional? Because you know why the fuck does the state need to be involved in my love life. 
-----==----==---==-----
A Civil union should describe two people coming together at the federal/state level, no matter what the sexual preferences are. A civil union through a religious service can be called a marriage. That way the religions would have the freedom to protect their marriages from state interferances.

Edit: People get upset when they think you're trying to change their religion. Let them have the word and sacrament of marriage, and let's use a different term for government purposes.

-----==----==---==-----
Very well - don't enforce laws that you believe are wrong. If someone breaks a law that you disagree with, no matter how "serious," just let them go. In fact, don't enforce laws for any crimes that have no victim. Unless there is an actual victim, just treat the situation as if no crime took place.

That would be my idea of a good police officer.

A side note: we're heavily influenced by those we spend time around. Our environment shapes us. If you join law enforcement thinking that you are going to change the game, it may end up that the game changes you instead.

You want to be a cop because you have noble intentions.
Don't believe that every bad cop out there didn't start out with the same noble intentions in mind.

We need more libertarians and good people in the police force to help keep an eye out for corruption and waste. I say go for it and just try to let people off for things like drugs you disagree with, as much as possible.

If you have an ethical problem with what your employer wants you to do, then don't work there.  If you want this job, you must set aside your personal beliefs and do they job you have been hired to do.  If you can do that, it is great work.  If not, you would just be a problem for everyone.  Find work that you are comfortable doing.
-----==----==---==-----
We need more good cops who respect rights, so I encourage you to become one.

Libertarians believe in free association. Free association is voluntary, consensual association. For example, going out on a date with someone. Going to the movies with a friend. Coming together to start a band, co-author a book, build a treehouse.

The other side of that coin: In order for some arrangement to be an instance of free association, then clearly the individuals in those arrangements must have the right to consent or not consent to them—to be free to leave, refuse and say no (think of sex vs. rape). (For example, if I put a gun to your head and tell you to build a tree house, then it is *not* free association.) The only time you have *free association* is if you have the right to refuse building the treehouse, or to say no to sex. Therefore, free association entails having the right to **individually secede** from any kind of arrangement.

Presumably, the LP is using the word "secession" because they are not concerned with treehouses but with a subset of associations: namely, *political* associations. You use the word "secede" when it deals with politics. The principle remains the same, however.

I've gone through LEO training and been sprayed with O.C., and I'll take the gas chamber from my Army training any day.  Also gone through "red man" training, and know that just one larger guy on your back pinning you down is enough to take all wind out of you and make you fear suffocating.  Combining both seems like a recipe for killing someone.

Someone once said that if bigfoot or aliens existed, we would have proof. Everyone has a camera phone, and someone somewhere would eventually post a photo they took. So since there are no photos or videos it is more and more likely they don't exist.

On the other hand we have videos and videos, and a lot of pictures of police brutality, so it does exist, and it is not as isolated as we are to believe. 

If they know they are on camera and act this way still, I wonder how much brutality happened before they knew they would be documented.

We need comprehensive police reform, is what it seems like to me. We need to completely overhaul the policies and practices that have become standard across every police department across the country. Maybe we could learn something from the Japanese, whose police and military are trained the "gentler" arts, whereby perps are de-commissioned efficiently with proper knowledge of anatomy and physics rather than plain brute force. There are much easier ways to take a guy down then to have five men dogpile him and beat him into unconsciousness. 
-----==----==---==-----

Policies have to change. These cops are doing what they are told. Keep that in mind. Good people + bad policies == bad cops.

We need to complain to our representatives and elected officials. The cops are not going to stop killing innocent people until they are made to stop.
-----==----==---==-----
I completely agree that what happened was terrible. I'm not going to excuse the actions of any person that causes the death of another.

However, we need to not put this in the same category as the other videos we've seen float through here in the past few days. There was no confrontational cop in this video. There is no evidence of a beating while he was subdued. No use of a taser on a man already on the ground. Having not seen the inciting event, we *cannot* jump to the conclusion that physical response by the police was not warranted. 

The Baltimore PD "You have no rights" officer attacked a bystander who had absolutely no connection to the call he was on. These officers killed the husband of the attacker and the father of the abused. We do not know how he got himself involved with the police and what actions he took.

The BPD denied the right to film the incident. This officer accepted and helped her work around the camera by offering to help her get her ID.

The entire incident with the BPD was recorded. Here we only have the terrible aftermath.

Yes, wrong. But let's refrain from putting these two events in the same bucket.
-----==----==---==-----
Obviously upsetting, but I think we need to see what happened before this video started to get a better idea of how much blame to throw at these guys. I hate police brutality as much as any real American should, but if they showed up to a domestic disturbance call and he became combative I sort of get why he'd be restrained/pepper sprayed.....sort of. 
-----==----==---==-----

Without seeing footage of what happened previously to where the video started, we can't make an assessment as to whether or not the police officers involved did anything wrong. That is a very big man, and it probably took every single one of them to hold him down and get him into handcuffs.

Don't fucking resist arrest. Accidents happen when you force 5 grown men to try to subdue you on concrete. None of these officers seemed vindictive or violent, they seemed to be trying to help.
-----==----==---==-----
The title is actually misleading. The local EMSA spokesperson said that the man was still alive while en-route to the hospital. He did not die on camera, during this incident. 

Let's not jump to conclusions when they haven't even completed/filed the autopsy report.

This might be the worst plan I've ever seen... 

So we're going to allow a bunch of unqualified doctors to give untested medicine (made under non-regulated conditions), but only to those who patients that insurance companies will willingly cover, as long as they aren't sick. 

Just so I'm not missing anything, is the libertarian position on health care that it's a privilege reserved for those with money? So people who are born poor and sick are just meant to.. what.. die in the street?

-----==----==---==-----
Simply put:

1. Anarcho-capitalism is against the state *and* endorses the concept of private property (aka. capitalism).

2. Anti-state libertarianism is against the state, but we are left unsure as to what it says about property rights. An anti-state libertarian can be left or right. If they are left, like libertarian-socialists, then they are still against the state but don't endorse private property. If they are anti-state libertarian on the right, then they are anarcho-capitalists.

So, anti-state libertarianism is synonymous with anarchism. Then there is right-anarchism vs. left-anarchism. Anarcho-capitalism is right-anarchism. So, that means anarcho-capitalists are just a subset of anti-state libertarians.
-----==----==---==-----
While most ancaps recognize the nap, perhaps a small number of them don't? Seems like a non point.

There is no singular form of property that is considered to be valid under libertarianism with exception of self-ownership/authority over one's own person and opinions. Libertarianism must therefore allow conventions on private property to form in the marketplace.

As with everything else, the best solutions relative to the natural conditions will appear. It's about reaching for the ideal of liberty and harmony, but since not everyone internalizes the non-aggression principle there will always be some issue, but that's why the NAP is valuable.
-----==----==---==-----
The free market could. Instead of the state approving a licence, there would just arise a niche for a private certification. People would invent their own licences that would become more or less well known. Kind of like the difference between a degree from DeVry and a degree from Harvard.

If no licences existed, the best solution might just be to get a reference or check their past work. And actually, that may even be the best way to be sure today even with licencing.
-----==----==---==-----
Yes.

In order to become a dentist a person must attend dental school.  In order for a school to provide a degree in dentistry it must be accredited.  The organizations that give accreditations are private; the market created them.  Thus, the market, which in this case is probably free, has provided us with qualified dentists.

In order for a qualified dentist to afford all the tools to practice dentistry he or she must earn income.  In order to earn income he must have clients.  Without clients he cannot earn income.  Thus, if a dentist performs poor quality dentistry, then he or she will decrease the likelihood of earning income sufficient to purchase dental equipment.  A dentist without sufficient dental equipment is unlikely to acquire clients, and will go out-of-business.

If you want to go to your buddies place and have him knock out your teeth with a hammer and a pair of pliers, the government won't stop you.   You can also go to witch doctors or whatever natural healer you want and have them fix you up by waving pigs ovaries over your head or having you chew on dandelions.

But we, the people, have asked that laws are put in place for medical practitioners, which in most but not all countries includes dentists.  Anyone can open a business and start charging people to knock out their teeth with a hammer as you requested (I'd love to read that waiver form...).   You just can't call yourself a dentist and advertise yourself as such, or lead people in any way to believe you are one.   We set standards as to a person who calls himself a dentist must maintain.  Once you have met those (minimum) standards, then the 'free market' takes over and people will flock to the better dentists, driving up prices/wait times/ availability/etc of those in higher demands.

It's the best of both worlds outcome.  I get to know my dentist isn't a quack and choose him/her based on factors I want, you get to still be a moron if you want.
-----==----==---==-----
Sweden here.

Sweden is top of the class when it comes to hiding taxes. All prices in stores are including VAT. And the VAT is 25%.

You don't pay your income tax. The income tax is drawn automatically from your salary every month. The income tax is approx. 33%. But wait, there's more! Before they even draw that income tax they have already drawn the employers fee, which they claim is not a tax on your income, but a tax on the employer. The fact that it is a percentage of your salary has nothing to do with it. The employers fee is almost as big as the income tax.

Add to this some really harsh extra taxes stuff like alcohol, gasoline, cigarets, etc. and there you go, 70% of your money gets taken by the state. But most swedes think they only pay 30%-35% of their money as tax, some thinks it's around 50%. Becaus we're top of the class at hiding taxes. Remember that the next time somebody talks about how great it is with "free" healthcare.

And if you want to discuss the supposed flaws of libertarianism, I will happily discuss it with you over Skype. I will explain everything. I'm disgustingly knowledgeable about libertarianism, so I think I will be able to address some of your concerns (or at minimum give you a fuller picture of what libertarianism is and why libertarians believe what they do). Spoiler: There really is no objection to it we haven't heard before. Really. I'm even surprised by how comprehensive libertarian thinkers have been (you kind of have to be when people accuse you of wanting to murder poor people all the time).

A very interesting analysis. A few highlights:

&gt; Once again, we see that libertarians look somewhat like liberals, but assign lower importance to values related to the welfare or suffering of others–the benevolence value.

&gt; According to Davis [56], low levels of empathic concern indicate lower levels of sympathy and concern for unfortunate others.

&gt; Consistent with the results on the Identification with All of Humanity scale, the libertarian independence from others is associated with weaker loving feelings toward friends, family, romantic partners, and generic others. It is noteworthy that differences between liberals and conservatives were generally small (except toward generic others). Libertarians were the outliers.

The federal Government should most defiantly not. that said the state should decide weather or not it should accept civil marriages on a majority rule vote. and with that nor the state or Fed can tell what a faith organisation should do ever.
-----==----==---==-----
This guy is a commie tard. Private business is private end of story
-----==----==---==-----
Is my convictions sound? ...

Why are you ok with any government entity being able to decide who gets to marry, and the legal/financial benefits that arise? Answer that, and once you realize the inconsistencies in still favoring an armed group of officials deciding who benefits, who fails, who wins, who loses, and all with stolen funds; you will be sound. 
-----==----==---==-----
States should not be able to deny anyone equal protection under the law, nor deny people their rights.  Nor should the federal government.  You have rights, regardless of the level of government.

Yup, we need money for aid, roads, war, peace, bailouts, jobs, infrastructure.. whatever. Just print it. If that was actually a viable solution, don't you think that world hunger would have been solved a century ago? 

Who are these morons that think a little bit of money printing is good, but a lot, well, that just won't work. It's like a minimum wage, attempting to address the symptoms, rather than acknowledging the cause of the disease. 

The world need economic growth, which is made possible by savings and the subsequent investments that leading to increased production. Which allows prices to fall relative to wages, resulting in rising living standards and more prosperous poor people, wealthy people and everyone in between. 

The reason why poor people in the U.S have it 100 times better than poor people in Africa is because we have had over a century of economic growth and development. Made possible by the establishment and enforcement of private property rights, which made capitalism and competitive markets possible. 

Where the hell was all the money printing? Aside from the numerous recessions and depressions, money printing did absolutely nothing to raise living standards. That's why poor countries that try to print money end up with riots in the streets and hyperinflation. 

Printing money is a luxury of a prosperous society, one in which bankers and politicians can enrich themselves and their politically connected cronies through defacto counterfeiting.. which is hidden thanks to all the economic growth that capitalism makes possible.

To quote what I perceived to be the overall sentiment of the libertarians in /r/worldnews in relation to this article: "Of course a socialist, statist loving organization would be in favor of taxation.  They're forgetting that government and taxation are inherently coercively violent and government only holds back the true glory of the market."
-----==----==---==-----
I figured I'd make a separate post to address both /u/DLeck and /u/LeeHyori .  

First, DLeck  

&gt; To quote what I perceived to be the overall sentiment of the libertarians in /r/worldnews in relation to this article: "Of course a socialist, statist loving organization would be in favor of taxation. They're forgetting that government and taxation are inherently coercively violent and government only holds back the true glory of the market."  

The first point about taxation being coercive/violent is not addressed in the paper.  

The second point, however, about holding back the "true glory of the market", is the direct topic of this paper. The argument of the paper is twofold. First, lower net inequality is a determining factor in both the pace of medium-term growth and the duration of growth spells. Second, and more surprisingly, redistribution has a neutral effect on growth, except in the extreme cases (like France, Netherlands) which have a negative effect.  

Thus, combining the two findings, redistribution has an overall positive effect on economic growth (unless the redistribution exceeds 13 Gini points), since it eventually lowers inequality, which is a strong determinant for growth.  

Now, to address LeeHyori  

&gt; Suppose it is true that it is "good for the economy."
Who determines what "good" consists in?
Is what is good by the previous criteria just?
Suppose we defined goodness in terms of which situation made more people happy. Suppose a room filled with 10 people. 9 of them would be ecstatic if Samantha were dead because she's a redhead, and therefore has no soul. Samantha, however, would prefer to live.
Therefore, it would be "better" for that society if we executed Samantha, granted more people would be happy. So, does that make executing Samantha right or just?  

The paper itself never uses the phrase "good for the economy", so I find it unfortunate that the writer of this article decided to use a phrase so ambiguous. All the paper discusses is whether or not inequality and redistribution have an effect on economic growth. The IMF researchers only make empirical claims in the paper. They acknowledge that, even if economic growth is higher and more sustainable with lower inequality, that may not be morally justified.

A PDF of the paper may be found here:

Remember fellow libertarians, its libertarianism that leads to chaos and anarchy.

Because having a government that constantly changes the rules, never knowing what you will be allowed to do or not do tomorrow, what your fines are going to be, what your taxes are going to be, where you can live, what you can say, what you can own, what you must own or get fined...that's *NOT* chaos or anarchy.

No, obey the rule of law like libertarians want *is* anarchy.

Luckily, gun owners do not have the burden of proof to show that they complied (such as removing it from the state or selling it to a dealer).  Just make sure you don't get caught with it.  You might as well get another gun though, or leave the state.  It would be sad if you used it properly in defense but still got charged after.

hrm, number 4 is funny. it says make arrangements to relinquish. If only someone had the balls to take their gun into a police station to relinquish their weapon unannounced to comply with the law. What kind of shit show that would turn out to be. Probably as good as any dead citizen story over a cop saying self-defense.

It's not like most guns aren't expensive either. That is crap if you outlaw a gun all of a sudden when it costs anywhere from $500-1000 for it. You are just suppose to give that shit up?

The whole thing is just turing into a massive Medicaid welfare expansion, and will not save any people, businesses or the government a single penny.    Just wait until those bills come due.

I'm far from a supply-sider, but there's a potential lurking variable here which throws a wrench in the mix:

&gt; The debate, then, turns on data. And, thanks to three researchers at the International Monetary Fund, we’ve got some striking new findings that answer the second question, whether tackling inequality reduces growth, with a firm no. Countries that take redistributive measures in order to attenuate inequitable market outcomes do not, on average, tend to grow less rapidly than other countries. Indeed, the contrary is true. They tend to grow a bit more rapidly.

It may be (and in fact seems likely) that governments take redistributive measures precisely *when* economic outlook looks strong. After all, assistance to the poor is something which tends to receive cuts during recessions, when government revenues tend to plummet. A more interesting experiment would be to pair countries with similar characteristics, increase social spending in one and decrease it in another, then analyze the pairs and see what patterns you notice. Understandably most governments would probably not be on board for such an experiment :).

Ever since Reddit was bought out by [Condé Nast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond%C3%A9_Nast_Publications), a subsidiary of [Advanced Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications), you could feel the shape of the website change. 

Start looking for things like GQ and Wired articles near the top with no comments. 

Combine that with the tone of the site being created by fake accounts and perpetually regulated by those whose minds are aligned with that will. [Link](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-reddit-got-huge-tons-of-fake-accounts--2)

We need a new Reddit, powered by bitcoin/bitcloud architecture, one with no possibility of censorship.

In practice the only rights anyone has are those they as an individual are capable of preventing others from infringing upon. Unfortunately rights of any sort don't actually exist no matter what societal organization you have. The constitution claims to give us all these rights yet we constantly see the government violating them. All corrupt countries have constitutions that give their subjects rights and they all think that whenever they violate those it is an exception for the greater good. Even the DPRK has a constitution guaranteeing their citizens the right to vote. They even have elections. But there is only one name on the ballot.

I highly doubt that the vocal defenders of the bill are coming from a principled, pro-liberty perspective. It grants the privilege of exercising freedom of association in private enterprise to a specific segment of the population and not to everyone (several articles in Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit discrimination on other grounds). 

Like most people in this subreddit, I rather scrap several sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (i.e. those proscribing discrimination in the private sphere) and *restore* the right of all individuals to run their business as they see fit. In sum, the Arizona bill does not address that broader issue. 

And, of course, the Social Justice Warrior outrage is facepalm-worthy. Their hearts are in the right place, but their heads are not.

[Here's](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1258&amp;context=historical) a fairly lengthy memo detailing the facts of the case (which Reuters does to some extent, but which hasn't stopped everybody from acting as if this is some sort of proactive censorship). It isn't a hate speech case, except inasmuch as the plaintiff felt that she had been taken advantage of for a film whose content she didn't agree with and asserts an independent copyright to her performance, whether or not that's justified.

Considering how much anti-whatever group material there is on YouTube, it's likely that if her performance were removed the clip could return to YouTube. Again, it isn't a hate speech issue; it was a specific case introduced by a performer in the film. Right wing blogs will go nuts misrepresenting this case and talking about "Shariah law," but let's be better than that.

-----==----==---==-----
I'll start by saying I don't at all disagree with his analysis, but I'm conflicted on this issue for a few reasons....

First, the old line "living in a free society means there will be people who do things you don't like, but it doesn't mean you can force them to stop".  People are free to be assholes...  they are (should) also be free to engage in free market exchanges in a way that is unhindered by government.  Forcing one person to do business with another person abolishes the consensual aspect of contracts and marketplace transactions.

There must be equality under the *law*, but I'm not sure the marketplace should be regulated in the same manner.  It is, to some extent, legislating what we think should be moral behavior - and many of us don't like the idea of legislating morality (except when we agree with it).  If we don't want to legislate morality, this includes not legislating behavior we deem to be moral...

I feel bad for the kid, but learning not to trust authority figures is one of the best lessons I took away from public school. If schools are supposed to prepare you for life, then, at least in a perverse sort of way, the education system is doing its job. EDIT: A word 
-----==----==---==-----
In Anchorage, public schools will suspend a kid involved in a fight no matter what. The suspension results in 
withdraw-fails due to missed classes and yet the administration insists that students should have to return back to their classes afterwards and put in effort even though they've already failed for the entire semester. This is why we have extremely high drop-out rates.

My husband was involved in a fight at the high school we went to about 12 years ago. He refrained from hurting the other kid (who threw the first punch) and was given the same amount of suspension time. His mother basically told him from that day forward if he has to fight, make sure to beat the shit out of the other kid and make it worth his while.

I think that the point of ZTPs are frankly to get kids used to the idea of always being watched and to fear the authorities.  Think about it.  A student who goes to a ZTP school has been through random searches since he was five, he's seen kids go down for asprin, he knows that stepping a toe out of line is going to get him in huge trouble.  You can't escape the school police state, no good intentions do any good, you've got another slave with [learned helplessness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) who has been taught that anything other than absolute obedience to authorities is painful and that there's nothing they can do about it.  Then, said kids grow up and vote for the authoritarian policies that they grew up with.

The problem here is that the blog misunderstands reddit. reddit did not censor any stores. The moderator of the "private" subreddit censored it. But it was also ran uncensored on many subreddits.

Also, it was censored from news subreddits. Perhaps rightly so because it is not news, it is speculation - more like an op/ed. 

Also of note are the posting guidelines for /worldnews

Not allowed:

* Editorialized titles

* Feature stories

* US internal news/US politics

* Editorials, opinion, analysis

Same with /news:

Your post will likely be removed if it:

*  is not news (or a meta post).

* is an opinion/analysis or advocacy piece.

Once you've "received your degree from Libertarian university" you've graduated away from seeing politics as a tool for good. At the most, you will have monkey wrench and defensive voter types who will exploit the system for the purposes of self-defense, but there are no principled libertarians for which compromising with unethical people is considered beneficial.
-----==----==---==-----
Possible typo. Page 3, line 6, near start of line, "that it not". 
-----==----==---==-----
Given that your thesis concerns *direct* taxation being theft, then you need to change your title to reflect that because as you stated in your paper you do not believe indirect taxation is theft.  

Review your paper after you do this, and make sure to *always* place the word "direct" immediately before the word "taxation" when arguing that taxation is theft.

Another option is to replace the word "direct" with "income".  Then, you won't have to expend as much space defining the kind of tax you are arguing is theft because your audience already knows what an income tax is.

Additionally, you may need to reconsider using "No taxation without representation" as your opening.  Your thesis concerns a direct tax, but the tax the colonists opposed was an indirect tax.  Thus, they were not opposing the kind of tax you are opposing, which makes their opposition irrelevant *to your thesis*.  Personally, I believe it would be better to use the fact that everyone makes tax deductions when filing their taxes as an example of how income tax is theft; I bet your instructor deducts from his or her taxes.  The act of deducting from one's taxes is the act of attempting to get one's money back.
-----==----==---==-----
First, I agree with Except-for-reality that you cannot make the statement that the government does not have the legal right to take a share of your property. They do. You may not like it, but that doesn't make it illegal.

You could amend your definition of stealing so that it does not reference legality in any way. For example, "stealing is the taking of other person's property without their explicit consent." However, by this definition many transactions that we do daily can come under "stealing". We almost never require "explicit consent." When I go to a restaurant, I do not sign a form or explicitly tell the owner that I will pay them at the end of my meal. The fact that I used their services implicitly says that I consent to pay. One could argue in the same way that your using government services implicitly says that you consent to pay taxes.

In any case, good luck with the argument.
-----==----==---==-----
You sidestepped the issue of current legality by arguing that it was previously not considered to be legal, and that this interpretation means that it should still be considered to (e: not) be legal, which doesn't gel for me, but other than that and a few grammatical errors (engrained should be ingrained, for instance) it seems solid.
-----==----==---==-----
You're a pretty good writer, but I want to second /u/buttzillalives' comment: you conclude that taxation is theft, in part, because "in both cases property is taken without...legal right..." This just isn't true. You can disagree with the amendment, and you can disagree with courts' opinions on the matter, but you can't claim that the government does not currently have the legal right to directly tax.
-----==----==---==-----
In the first paragraph you wrote

&gt;The United States government began directly taxing citizens’ income during the last century 

However, income tax first occurred in the United States in the 1800's until it was found unconstitutional. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#Early_federal_income_taxes

----

In the third paragraph you have

&gt;The verb steal is defined as “to take another person’s property without permission or legal right and without intending to return it” (“Steal”).

Somebody would easily argue that the government has the legal right to your property. (Social contract, Constitution, laws).

You may want to talk about extortion rather than theft / stealing. Extortion (I believe) is a more fitting word. According to google extortion is: "the practice of obtaining something, esp. money, through force or threats." That is exactly what the government does. They may have the "legal right" to take your money, but they are doing it through force and / or threats.

----

Your views seem a little weird. Direct taxation is wrong, but indirect is just fine and dandy? With indirect taxation the government forces their way into a voluntary transaction. If you decide to purchase something from a friend am I allowed to force you to pay 10% of that money to me? If you wish to trade with somebody else the third party (government) is forcing you to also give them money.

----

&gt;Indirect taxes can be avoided by not purchasing the goods or services that have taxes levied on them. 

Direct taxes can be avoided by making below the tax threshold (income tax) and not owning property (property tax). You have double standards. Taxes are acceptable when you buy something, but not when you make money. Seems rather weird.

----

&gt; The income of an individual is their property, just like any other good they own. The property confiscated to fulfill an individual’s tax obligation will also not be returned to the individual.

Just like indirect taxes. For sales taxes the item being sold is somebody's property and the money used to purchase the item is somebody's property. The tax money taken by the government will not be returned to the individual.

----

&gt;Although some may receive tax returns at the end of the taxation period, the amount is never more than the original amount that was originally taken. 

No, but the exact amount somebody paid may be returned meaning it doesn't always meet your definition of theft. I personally consider it theft when they take your money for a couple months then return it (even if it is the whole amount).

----

&gt;John R. Rowan states, “only taxes that go toward the services provided by the state are permissible” (##) because they do not redistribute property from one individual to another.

Are you supposed to have (##)? You have this in multiple spots.

Anyways, taxes always ultimately redistribute property from one individual to another. Police officers, firemen, and politicians will receive the tax money. When the government uses taxes for roads or whatever that is going to workers and companies that sell the supplies. Even if all tax money stays in the bank that is still going to likely going to be redistributed (through loans of the bank).

----

All taxes are theft/stealing/extortion/whatever. Direct taxes are theft. Indirect taxes are theft.

"'Even if it were determined later on that the emissions from e-cigarettes aren't dangerous to a bystander in an outside environment, the existence of devices like this…in public places does threaten to renormalize the behavior of smoking,' [City Attorney Mike Feuer] said." At least he's being honest about the fact that this decision is solely designed to help support state sponsored thought control.

Well if they're gonna do this, they better be banning ugly fat people too. Haven't wee been fighting that for half a century as well?

Anyone aware of any extant case law on "excessive" fines?
-----==----==---==-----
Philadelphia has similar excessive fines.

Sorry - missed the part of the Constitution that enshrined your right to park anywhere you want without costs or ramifications.

Is r/libertarian really at the point where we think there's a valid libertarian argument against paying for stuff that we use, like parking? 

The fines charged seem pretty reasonable compared to man private businesses, and as long as the government is selling you parking, I see no reason that it should act any differently than any other pay parking lot.

It's going to be so easy for cops to use psychological manipulation, lies and threats to impose on occupants such as kids to gain warrantless access to peoples homes.
-----==----==---==-----
Jesus Christ, how hard is it to get a warrant these days? Judges practically hand those things out like candy anyway. Next you're going to see the legal argument become, "Well a judge would have issued a warrant if we requested one, therefore no rights were violated based on the technicality that we didn't have a warrant."
-----==----==---==-----
So, I invite a buddy over to watch the game. An officer shows up and requests to search my house, I say no, but, my buddy (who doesn't live there) says, "Sure, come on in!"  This gives them permission to enter my home?
-----==----==---==-----
How long till a ruling is set that requires a person to invoke their 4th amendment rights, otherwise the government can just search anything they want assuming you granted them by not invoking?

That's now my lowest quoted rate. I'm in good health and young. This is the cheapest plan offered. I had a similar plan that helped cover medical costs (i only pay 30% of medical bills + $20 primary visits) for $120. I'm not buying this piece of shit health plan. I cant afford the $400 ones that actually help pay costs before i'm dying. 
-----==----==---==-----
Do you quality for rebates? I highly doubt you were getting "decent" healthcare for $120 a month.

Wasn't this the the plot of Minority Report?
-----==----==---==-----
Headline is inflammatory stupidity.  

Some factors are predictive of criminal behavior, that's a fact.  The article expresses concern that the models will be relied upon more than their merits (yes) and that there will be errors (yes) and that scope creep will lead to a bigger problem (also true).

The content of the article is good, but the headline is pandering bullshit.  The CPD never says it can "see the future".

So does this model include itself in the model?

Let's say it works, and starts deterring crime in the areas it predicts. But a bad guys gots to be a bad guy, so he'll go to some other place. Does the model take into account this shift?

There are 32000+ laws on the books in the United States.  So many so that the federal government has actually lost count.   Many of these laws tie in executive orders, administrative polices of various government agencies and in some cases foreign laws. 

Odds are very very good that your going to break at least one of them.

These brave cops are doing a good job protecting the public! They aren't arresting people, just letting the scumbag criminals know the cops are on to them! Good job!

Nearly *all* jobs used to be apprenticed into. Including most white collar jobs. It was the responsibility of the *employer* to train or send back to school his best and brightest.        

Today we've pushed that back on young people in the form of student debt. Huge corporate welfare right there! Oh well, fuck the young people they don't need money for, you know, a family, a home or a car. Hell while we're at it lets force the healthy youth to pay onto unneeded insurance plans so that *our* insurance cost less.

Please think of the government employees at the Department of Licensing and Regulation who would be out of jobs if permission slips were not required!  Oh, the humanity!

I suppose he answer is some sort of cosmetology guild that certifies eye brow threaders. 

But then, which guild does John Q. Public trust? 

The international brotherhood of cosmetology workers? An organization that has as members 90% of all cosmetologists. 

Or the intranational brotherhood of cosmetology workers? The guild I founded in my garage last week? 

Caveat emptor is the law of trade, I suppose, eh?

I'd like to see the source for the 40% figure. Unless there's a lot more lawyers and doctors than I thought...

The article that this is link is sourced to makes the point that these licenses are industry driven.  They exist inverse to union membership, implying that one form of protectionism was replaced by another.

liberals would read this and think "who cares, I dont even know what eyebrow threading is" with zero depth of vision into the bigger issue.
-----==----==---==-----
There are times when it is comforting to know a person has gone through a minimum of training to be able to do a given job. 

I have to do it to be a firefighter and an EMT; plus certificates that go along with other skills I have picked up along the way that show I can safely drive a huge red fire engine, or operate a pump correctly.

Yes, there may be some apparent silliness to having eyebrow threaders learning other skills(which include cleanliness issues), but for the bulk of things out there, I would rather be sure that my doctor didn't buy his degree from the internet or that the local truck driver learns how to operate a truck safely so he doesn't crash into my family.

Perhaps you'd like to spend time in a country where regulations are lax to non-existent and see what kind of things you would be taking for granted.

"I think there is a certain subset of the population that views DEA agents as jackbooted thugs, that have an agenda to oppress them....

Awesome post. I'm most interested in the peer-2-peer payment system. Would be interesting to see how peer-2-peer 'cloud' browsing would work. Being able to freely browse the internet behind layers of sophisticated cryptography algorithms impenetrable by NSA goons is a dream of mine.

Thanks for the list. I would definitely add 3D-printing (especially those 3D-printers that can print all parts needed to replicate itself) to the list. We need more decentralization ideas outside of the software world :)

And even without decentralization, we realized how just social media (twitter, facebook, blogosphere etc..) have obseleted the mainstream media and how community driven content (wikipedia, open-source softwares etc..) have obseleted classic libraries and difficulty of information access.

With decentralization, this freedom indeeds grows by many more orders of magnitude and giving back power to the people.

Those cops stole 35 days of his freedom and a lifetime of presumed innocence. No matter how well they wipe this from the record something will remain that will haunt him later.

Couldn't they just charge him with obstruction of justice? After all, every day he lounged in their jail cell is a day they weren't out solving the case.
-----==----==---==-----
&gt;Attorney Kristopher Nowicki, who is representing Williams in his potential civil action, said a photo lineup could have prevented Williams’ arrest.

&gt;“It seems that there was no investigation done other than my client’s name,” he said. “It is not Cody Williams’ obligation to investigate crimes on behalf of the state of Florida.”

From the article.....

&gt; Three officers have received formal counseling for their role in the wrongful arrest and another officer faces a 10-day unpaid suspension and a transfer from investigations to patrol....

Oh, thank goodness! My first thought was, "are those officers going to be ok?".....it looks they might be punished, but the counseling should really be more than enough to ensure that they'll be out on the streets soon, "protecting and serving"!

But in all fairness, there should be no punishment for the LEO's, because let's face it, since the teen had the same name except for the middle name being different, it's really the teens fault. There are really two lessons here:

1. You can't expect police to notice the hidden middle name. Heck....who would?

2. You shouldn't have the same name as a sexual predator.

I'll be praying for those cops!

As an aside, I hope that teen get's whats coming to him for tricking those cops into giving him free room and board for 35 days using the "hidden middle name" trick. That teen owes the tax payers their money back!!!!

-----==----==---==-----
I don't care so much about punishment of the officers.  What restitution is being made for this poor boy?  I hate seeing these sorts of things happen, and nothing is done for the victim.
-----==----==---==-----
So, if he had a job that he lost, or even lost income from, could he sue the police?

Why am I not surprised that Angela Corey was involved in this. That woman is a black mark on my state and needs to be unemployed.

I'm not sure how many of you are old enough to remember this, but one of the platforms of Clinton's first campaign was "to put 100,000 more police officers on the street."  I would vote for any presidential candidate who vowed to take 200,000 off the street today.  
-----==----==---==-----
This family will sue and the tax payers will pay for this cops incompetence, while he keeps his union protected job. If a truck driver is driving negligently and wrecks, they can be held personally responsible for damages, not just the company they work for. This is an insensitive to do their job carefully, because lives are on the line. Who thought it was a good idea to make it so cops have no accountability for their actions as cops? This investigator should be sued.
-----==----==---==-----
Florida.. of course.

taxation is my homes states solution to everything.

It's not Illinois, it's those idiots from Chicago who want to aggressively race to the bottom with New York City.  I think this will probably get stopped because those Chi-tards propose every bad idea they can think(?) of, and usually fail.    
-----==----==---==-----
Illinois politicians have never met a tax they didn't like.
-----==----==---==-----
I hoped that something like this would stay in places like New York and never come to the Midwest.  I hate my state's government.
-----==----==---==-----
They know what's best for you.
-----==----==---==-----
You tax things you want less of. This is a sound economic principle, despite libertarian butthurt.
-----==----==---==-----
Take note of the cop's claim.  "You diverted my attention."  This is going to become their go-to justification whenever they want to harass or arrest bystanders.  But it seems to me that the statement is actually an admission of how poor the cop's frame control really is.  

Note how they don't say "You distracted me."  That makes the officer's lack of control over his own thought process a lot more clear.  It's "You diverted my attention", putting blame on the victim.
-----==----==---==-----
Pretty typical of Maryland, especially Baltimore County. What rights you get to exercise are entirely dependent on how good of an attorney you can afford. 
-----==----==---==-----
Why aren't more people standing their ground against this thuggery? We just need a few videos of people legally defending their personal space on a public walkways/easements circulating. People need to know that cops don't get the final word legally.

"Do you see the police presence here? Do not disrespect us, and do not not [sic] listen to us."

These words filled me with fear and rage. Who the fuck to these thugs think they are?
-----==----==---==-----
Was the cop given a field sobriety test because he sounds like he's under the influence of something.  
-----==----==---==-----
Those officers should be terminated and imprisoned.  
-----==----==---==-----
**This is authoritarianism.**

I don't think Americans should have to answer to these types of malicious animals anymore.
-----==----==---==-----
I would have stood my ground and let him arrest me and then pressed charges for battery. 

That is ridiculous.

Cops are not above the law nor do they have the authority to revoke one of our constitutional rights.

"Hey Man,  there's only a few bad eggs"  Bullshit. Videos like this come out every day.  

EDIT:  [Here's one more from just today](http://news.kron4.com/news/video-father-dies-in-confrontation-with-police/) These are just the ones being video taped.  Not every incident of police brutality and murder are brought under investigation. 
-----==----==---==-----
Does anyone else believe that the integrity of policework will go way up when everyone is recording everything from a google glass-like device?

And the camera can't be construed as 'distracting'?
-----==----==---==-----
Besides recording the police, the other issue that needs to be resolved is this legal or de facto immunity that cops enjoy.  In this instance, this cop should be charged with assault, like anyone else who assaults someone.  The physical contact between himself and the cameraman was not a part of his job at that time, therefore it's assault.  If other cops aid the assailant in covering up the assault or attempt to use their position to deflect responsibility from the assailant, they should be charged with obstruction of justice or for being an accessory after the fact.

If cops were actually arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned for this sort of behavior, you'd see it decrease pretty rapidly.  If they have a reasonable expectation that they will never be punished for assaulting a civilian, they will continue to assault civilians.
-----==----==---==-----
In situations like this, we need the names and stations of ~~cops~~ thugs with badges like this and there needs to be a public shaming and follow up.

This was a cop riot. Who were these guys? I mean, they're on video, right? 
-----==----==---==-----
Just another example of how inept some officers are at doing their jobs.  However, it would seem like the person videotaping this did himself no favors by continuing to antagonize the officers after they told him to walk away.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for videotaping the police whenever possible, but it also works against the person videotaping when they throw it in the face of the officers that they're able to record them. 
-----==----==---==-----
so what are we doing about this?
-----==----==---==-----
Jesus that fat ignorant slob reminds me of the hillbillies from Deliverance. "Why you filmin' here city boy? You wanna squeal like a piggy?"
-----==----==---==-----
The officers should be trained in the Mandt system: de-escalate the situation.
-----==----==---==-----
Garbage!!! How do we let them to continue to get away with this!!

They were bullied as children, so they grow up to be the bullies.  Probably also have a case of small penis syndrome.

Honestly there's not much left to be said about cops doing this. But privatizing law enforcement would be one
